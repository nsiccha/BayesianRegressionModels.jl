# Structural companion for the CDC `ww-inference-model`
# (github.com/CDCgov/ww-inference-model): a joint wastewater +
# hospital-admissions renewal model on BRM's StanBlocks backend. Authorized by
# decision `2026-08-26T16-44-33-638-1yz7ybe` (option B).
#
# The upstream model has four coupled pieces; the comments below identify which
# semantics this executable structural companion preserves.
#
#  1. INFECTION PROCESS. Reference-subpopulation weekly unadjusted log-Rᵘ follows a
#     differenced autoregression, `log Rᵘ(tᵢ)=log Rᵘ(tᵢ₋₁)+β·Δ+σ_r ε` (`dar_logru`).
#     The realized reproduction number carries INFECTION FEEDBACK,
#     `R(t)=Rᵘ(t)·exp(−γ Σ_τ I(t−τ)g(τ))`, and incidence follows the renewal
#     equation with a 50-day exponential seeding phase (`renewal_feedback`).
#
#  2. MULTI-SUBPOPULATION HIERARCHY. K catchment subpopulations (+ a reference)
#     each carry `log Rᵘ_k = log Rᵘ_0 + m + δ_k(t)` with δ_k an AR(1) deviation
#     (`ar1_dev`); each runs its own renewal, and jurisdiction incidence is the
#     population-weighted aggregate `I(t)=Σ_k w_k I_k(t)`.
#
#  3. WASTEWATER OBSERVATION (per subpopulation/site). Genome concentration is the
#     shedding-kinetics convolution of that subpopulation's infections scaled by
#     genomes-per-infection / per-person volume (`shed_convolve`, `log_shed_scale`);
#     site-lab measurements are log-normal with a site scaling `M_k` and a
#     hierarchical observation SD `σ_c,k`, with below-limit-of-detection
#     left-censoring.
#
#  4. HOSPITAL-ADMISSIONS OBSERVATION (jurisdiction). Expected admissions convolve
#     aggregate infections with an infection-to-hospitalization delay
#     (`delay_convolve`), scaled by a time-varying AR(1)-logit IHR and a day-of-week
#     Dirichlet effect; counts are negative-binomial.
#
# The carried-state parts (renewal, AR processes, all convolutions) live in
# `@deffun`s and are called loop-free from the `@slic` body — `plate` broadcasts the
# per-subpopulation renewal+wastewater cell over independent subpopulations, and the
# aggregate + hospitalizations are ordinary top-level statements on the collected
# infection matrix.
#
# Verified: transpile + stanc + finite BridgeStan density/gradient (dim=379 on the
# default fixture); see `test/cdc_ww_inference.jl`. NOT sampled — the deliverable is
# the model. The generation-interval / shedding / delay PMFs and priors are
# illustrative discretizations, not calibrated values.

    cdc_ww_brm_fixture(; K = 3, nt = 84, uot = 50, ht = 14)

Multi-frame fixture for [`cdc_ww_brm_model`](@ref). `K` is the number of latent
subpopulations and includes an uncovered reference population at index one. The
latent kernel has one row per subpopulation, while wastewater measurements occupy
their own sparse record frame with explicit time, subpopulation, lab-site and LOD
mappings. Several lab sites may map to one catchment and repeated sampling times are
valid. Count records occupy a second independent frame: each names a stream and an
inclusive interval, while stream-level matrices map latent subpopulations and delay
kernels. Matching forecast mappings reuse both observation components without
joining the calibration likelihood.
