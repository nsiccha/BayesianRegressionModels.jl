# Simple formulas, room for custom models

This editable Quarto RevealJS deck explains how BayesianRegressionModels.jl
combines concise regression formulas with custom scientific calculations.
The main example uses formulas for subject effects and a custom block for a
drug-concentration curve. It is followed by larger structural examples, an
authoring comparison with brms and hand-written models, the corrected HSGP
centering study, prediction, and a possible future Reactant/XLA GPU path.

Execution coverage and verification limits are stated next to the examples.
The six-slide appendix supplies the complete PK example, current execution
support, generated-code references, scientific evidence, and sources. The
deck does not claim universal backend parity or propose an inference-method
research agenda.

`source-examples.lua` reads the Gaussian and population-PK declarations from
`docs/src/feature-atlas.md` at render time. Two PK slides extract its model body
and data; appendix B shows the full declaration. These are source excerpts,
not manually invented generated Stan/Turing programs. The normal documentation
build executes the feature atlas and generates its backend views.

The Gaussian example generates both StanBlocks/Stan and Turing code. The PK
example generates StanBlocks/Stan code; Turing currently rejects its ragged
response decorator. That limit is visible on the PK slides, not just in notes.
After preparing the normal docs environment, check those exact declarations
and their stated construction support from the repository root with:

```sh
julia --startup-file=no --project=docs docs/presentations/brm-futures/check-examples.jl
```

This is a focused construction/emission check, not a sampling or gradient test.

`source-results.lua` supplies the HSGP study's numbers the same way, through
`brm-hsgp` and `brm-source-audit` shortcodes evaluated at render time. Per-fit
divergences, efficiencies, ESS, split R-hat and gradient counts come from
`research/centering_refresh/results/hsgp/comparison.tsv`; the frame-check count
and WarmupHMC revisions from the same directory; the partial-target audit
maxima from `research/adaptive_centering/results/source-faithful/`. The filter
also confirms that the refreshed post-hoc position choices equal the source
reproduction's selection. A missing value or a changed selection fails the
render, so a refit cannot leave stale numbers in the deck.

The visual system follows the StanCon 2026 StanBlocks.jl presentation at
StanBlocks.jl revision `c0b5b9197e2d06cf284f1990db024c37ed2b9d47`:
Reveal `simple`, a 1600×900 canvas, warm paper, Avenir/Inter typography, Stan
maroon rules, muted blue/gold accents, and flat cards. This deck retains its
example-specific support labels.

## Render

From the repository root:

```sh
docs/presentations/brm-futures/render.sh
```

The script renders one self-contained RevealJS file, verifies a pinned MathJax
3 runtime, freezes its SVG equations into the document, removes that build-time
runtime, and prints the result to a landscape PDF with Chrome's RevealJS print
stylesheet. It rejects external runtime resources and writes the public
artifacts to `docs/src/public/decks/` so the normal VitePress build publishes
them unchanged.

The HTML includes speaker notes (`S` in a non-embedded presentation; support
can be limited by RevealJS self-contained mode). The PDF intentionally omits
notes. Source, notes, and references remain in `brm-futures.qmd` and this file.

## BRM provenance

The formulas/custom-code rewrite was checked against BRM revision
`8dfe41253af3043482cb3270cf513b50a1de5437`. The HSGP results follow the
refreshed centering study introduced in
`4dc28de1039303300b532fc778cb6ace0b6d46f1`, which replaced comparisons recorded
before WarmupHMC's active-position transport repair. The executable case-study
source is
<https://github.com/nsiccha/BayesianRegressionModels.jl/blob/ns/devibe/docs/src/adaptive-centering.md>.

The adaptive case is derived from:

- Generable, “HSGP Reparameterization”:
  <https://www.generable.com/post/hsgp-reparam>
- Companion materials, immutable revision
  `0d00b8535e2c20c49017d03c7b060940eb8e7041`:
  <https://github.com/generable/public-materials/tree/0d00b8535e2c20c49017d03c7b060940eb8e7041/blog/hsgp-reparam>
- `MASS::mcycle` data revision
  `1dcc2bf5f955cc1224a3e1307256e1fe86b68dae`, raw CSV SHA-256
  `b89a1e4eb0391a982b32be3e378df00e8593ff9971e9425e9c5d7929b74f9801`.

Appendix D's source reproduction uses the committed source-faithful artifacts
under `research/adaptive_centering/results/source-faithful/`: all 133
observations, two 20-frequency HSGPs, source-equivalent log-hyperpriors,
`Xoshiro(1)`, 10,000 retained draws per fit, and unchanged WarmupHMC defaults.
The results slide and appendix E use `research/centering_refresh/results/hsgp/`:
fixed NCP and CP, plus post-hoc and online fits for both the position and the
gradient loss. Its post-hoc position fit is the source workflow. Each fit is one
chain, so split R-hat is a within-chain diagnostic rather than evidence that
independent chains agree, and the results are not a general efficiency
guarantee. No Turing posterior samples exist; the separate Turing gradient
benchmark in `test/receipts/turing_hsgp_gradients.tsv` is not sampling
evidence.

## Possible Julia-to-XLA GPU path

Primary documentation checked on 2026-09-14:

- Reactant's Julia-to-MLIR/XLA compilation and device support:
  <https://enzymead.github.io/Reactant.jl/stable/>
- Probabilistic programming, including a custom-log-density interface:
  <https://enzymead.github.io/Reactant.jl/stable/tutorials/probprog/>
- Tracing and control-flow requirements:
  <https://enzymead.github.io/Reactant.jl/stable/tutorials/control-flow>
- brms already exposes Stan/OpenCL for eligible operations:
  <https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/opencl.html>

This establishes a compiler route to investigate. It does not establish that
BRM's current Julia/Turing models already compile through Reactant or run faster
on a GPU. The user's suggested Wren connection could not be identified in the
public primary sources reviewed; no specific Wren-to-Reactant relationship is
asserted in the presentation.
