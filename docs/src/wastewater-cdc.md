# CDC `ww-inference-model`: an executable structural port

This page maps the four coupled components of CDC's
[`ww-inference-model`](https://github.com/CDCgov/ww-inference-model) onto the
`@brm` formula surface: infection renewal, subpopulation variation, wastewater
measurements, and hospital admissions. It is an executable **structural port**, not
a drop-in or numerically equivalent reproduction of the current CDC model. The
comparison below is verified through transpilation, `stanc`, and a finite
BridgeStan density/gradient by `test/cdc_ww_inference.jl`; those gates establish a
working model artifact, not posterior parity with CDC.

For a smaller introduction to the renewal and shedding pieces, start with the
[single-catchment wastewater example](/wastewater). A parallel StanBlocks-native
case study is available in the
[StanBlocks documentation](https://nsiccha.github.io/StanBlocks.jl/dev/examples/case-studies/wastewater).

## The current model on the `@brm` formula surface

This is a genuinely multi-level, multi-stream renewal model. Its composition is on
the formula surface, while the sequential numerical kernels are ordinary
`@deffun`s. The seams are:

- **Shared reference log-Rᵘ** — `log_ru_week ~ 1 + ar(week_grid; p=1)` is
  expanded onto the daily latent axis and closed over inside each
  per-subpopulation cell.
- **Latent subpopulation hierarchy** — `I_mat ~ kernel(t_grid, is_reference,
  logit_I0, initial_growth) do … end` broadcasts only the renewal process. Each
  cell draws an AR(1) deviation and returns its infection trajectory; the uncovered
  reference cell suppresses that deviation.
- **Infection feedback and renewal** — `renewal_feedback` performs the carried-state
  scan inside each cell.
- **Sparse wastewater measurements** — `ww_expected_log` gathers arbitrary
  `(time, subpopulation, lab)` records from the collected latent matrix. The
  left-censored log-normal likelihood uses a separate lab hierarchy and one LOD per
  record, so a latent subpopulation may have no wastewater records and several labs
  may observe the same catchment/time pair.
- **Jurisdiction aggregation** — `wsum(I_mat, w)` forms a population-weighted
  infection trajectory.
- **Hospital admissions** — a delay convolution, weekly time-varying logit IHR,
  mean-one simplex weekday effect, and negative-binomial likelihood consume the
  aggregate trajectory.

The carried-state scans cannot be written as formula statements or `kernel`
control flow. `wsum` similarly owns the cross-cell matrix multiplication because
`*` at formula level is the Wilkinson interaction operator. These are the
interesting numerical kernels, so their exact checked-in Julia definitions are
shown rather than left as opaque calls:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.source_code_region(
    "research/wastewater/cdc_ww_inference.jl";
    starting_at="StanBlocks.@deffun begin",
    ending_before="\"\"\"\n    cdc_ww_inference_fixture",
)
```

The setup below evaluates those same definitions and the fixture before the
four-pane comparison is built.

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.evaluate_source_prelude(
    Main.BRMDocsComparisons.example_module(:cdc_ww),
    "research/wastewater/cdc_ww_inference.jl";
    before=:cdc_ww_brm_model,
    starting_at="StanBlocks.@deffun begin",
)
nothing
```

The declaration is extracted verbatim from `cdc_ww_brm_model`; the StanBlocks and
Stan panes are generated from the resulting `BRMI` during the docs build.

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(
    Main.BRMDocsComparisons.example_module(:cdc_ww),
    Main.BRMDocsComparisons.source_function(
        "research/wastewater/cdc_ww_inference.jl", :cdc_ww_brm_model,
    ),
    :cdc_ww_brm_model;
    title="CDC ww-inference structural port (@brm formula surface)",
    require_stan=true,
)
```

The Turing pane is retained even though this structural kernel is outside the
current Turing executor. Its construction error documents that backend boundary.

## What matches, and what does not yet match

The example preserves the high-level causal order from CDC's
[`model_definition.md`](https://github.com/CDCgov/ww-inference-model/blob/main/model_definition.md):

1. Unadjusted reproduction numbers drive feedback-adjusted renewal incidence.
2. Subpopulation trajectories vary around a shared process and aggregate by
   population weight.
3. Shedding-convolved subpopulation incidence drives censored wastewater
   measurements.
4. Delay-convolved aggregate incidence drives weekday-adjusted hospital counts.

The current fixture now includes the CDC model's distinct latent and observation
axes: a 50-day unobserved period, an uncovered reference population, sparse and
repeated site/lab/time records, record-specific detection limits, lab-level scale
and noise effects, a normalized inferred triangular shedding trajectory, hierarchical
first-observed incidence and growth with CDC's seeding back-calculation, bounded
stationary subpopulation AR deviations, and a mean-one simplex weekday multiplier.

It does **not** yet reproduce these defining CDC details:

- the weekly **differenced**-AR global log-R process (the formula model currently
  uses an ordinary weekly AR term) and CDC's exact mean-reverting IHR
  parameterization;
- the exact upstream hyperprior values supplied by CDC's R interface; or
- component switches, composable count-stream mappings, interval aggregation, and
  the forecast/generated-quantity contract.

The executable upstream
[`wwinference.stan`](https://github.com/CDCgov/ww-inference-model/blob/main/inst/stan/wwinference.stan)
is authoritative for those details. “Structural port” here means that the four
components are coupled in the same causal order; it does not mean that their
parameterizations, data axes, or priors are identical.

## Relation to the StanBlocks form

The reproduction file also carries a pure-StanBlocks `@slic` companion,
`cdc_ww_inference_model`. It uses the differenced-AR helper directly and broadcasts
subpopulation parameters with `plate`. The `@brm` `kernel` term serves the same
sampling role: parameters such as subpopulation innovations and initial incidence
are introduced per cell, while `@deffun` owns only deterministic recurrence.

The companion is closer to CDC on the global R process, but it shares several
simplifications listed above and is not presented as a numerical reference
implementation.

## BRM authoring boundary exposed by this port

The public `@brm` surface can express an ordinary AR(1) predictor with
`ar(week_grid; p=1)`, but it cannot currently declare the weekly vector innovations
needed by CDC's differenced-AR process. That gap is tracked as BRM snag
`brm-formula-diff-52808dea`. Until a shared formula primitive is approved and
landed, this page labels the ordinary-AR substitution rather than presenting it as
posterior-equivalent. The recurrence itself is already expressible as a small
`@deffun`; the awkward part is declaring and composing the latent vector on the
formula surface with replay and descriptor semantics.

## Provenance

Reproduction:
[`research/wastewater/cdc_ww_inference.jl`](https://github.com/nsiccha/BayesianRegressionModels.jl/blob/ns/devibe/research/wastewater/cdc_ww_inference.jl),
gated by `test/cdc_ww_inference.jl`. Both the `@slic` and `@brm` forms are checked
for transpilation and `stanc`; the default fixtures are also checked for a finite
BridgeStan density and gradient. The discretized kernels and priors remain
illustrative. The models are not sampled here and the gate is not a
posterior-equivalence test against CDC.

## Run the reproduction

After bootstrapping the repository's test environment:

```sh
julia --startup-file=no --project=test test/cdc_ww_inference.jl
```

Set `BRM_KERNEL_RUNTIME=0` to run lowering and `stanc` without BridgeStan
instantiation.
