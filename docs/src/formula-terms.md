# Formula terms

## Catalogue

Every term below lowers on the StanBlocks backend (`SBBRMI`); the
`VBRMI` column marks the ones the pure-Julia backend also implements. The pages
that follow document the terms whose behaviour is not obvious from the
signature — the rest are covered by their docstrings on the [API](@ref) page.

### Predictor terms

| Term | What it contributes | `VBRMI` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offset(x)` | `x` added with coefficient one — no `beta_pop` column | ✓ |
| `s(x)` | rank-10 penalized thin-plate regression spline | — |
| `t2(x, z)` | two-margin tensor-product smooth | — |
| `gp(x…; cov=:exp_quad, iso=true, jitter=1e-9)` | exact latent Gaussian process, noncentered Cholesky draw | — |
| `hsgp(x…; k=20, c=1.5, iso=true, by=nothing, domain=nothing, orthogonal_to=nothing)` | Hilbert-space GP approximation over `prod(k)` basis functions | — |
| `ar(time; p=1)` | AR(p) noise process ordered by `time`; only `p=1` is emitted | — |
| `dar(time; p=1)` | direct differenced-AR(1) trajectory with bounded persistence and scaled innovations | — |
| `mo(c)`, `mo1(c)` | monotonic effect of an ordered factor via Dirichlet increments | — |
| `me(x, sd)` | measurement-error covariate — `x` is observed with known `sd` | — |
| `interval_censored(x; upper=lloq, lower=0)` | quantified/BLOQ covariate with bounded latent values on BLOQ rows | — |
| `factor(c; ref=k)` | treatment contrasts for a categorical column, reference level `k` | ✓ |
| `protect(x)` | materialize a raw data expression as one literal column | ✓ |

A plain RHS expression in raw data columns (`log(exposure)`, `x^2`) is treated
as an implicit `protect(...)` and materialized the same way.

### Differenced-AR(1) trajectories

`dar(time; p=1)` is not an alias for `ar(time; p=1)`. It emits the path

```
x[1] = 0
d[t] = beta * d[t-1] + sigma * z[t]    # d[0] = 0
x[t+1] = x[t] + d[t]
```

as a direct predictor summand. In `log_r_week ~ 1 + dar(week)`, the population
intercept is therefore the initial level `x0`; the trajectory receives no
second `beta_pop` multiplier. The term samples `beta` on `[0, 1]`, a positive
innovation scale `sigma`, and `length(week)-1` standardized innovations `z`.
Its defaults are the CDC wastewater priors `beta ~ Normal(0.5, 0.2)` truncated
to `[0, 1]` and `sigma ~ Normal(0, 0.2)` truncated at zero.

The time column must be nonempty, finite, strictly increasing, and unique.
Its values establish order; spacing does not rescale the recurrence. Expand a
weekly path onto a daily axis explicitly with a deterministic index operation
such as `log_r = weekly_expand(log_r_week, week_idx)`. `reprocess` may replace
the ordered grid, including its length, without changing the Stan source.

Configure the two model-scale priors by addressing the term:

```julia
ar(:, dar(week)) ~ Normal(0.4, 0.1)  # bounded persistence beta
sd(:, dar(week)) ~ Normal(0.0, 0.3)  # positive innovation sigma
```

`ar` accepts `Normal`, `Beta`, or an in-bounds `Uniform`; `sd` accepts the
positive-scale family set documented below. The standardized `z` innovations
are inspectable through the descriptor but deliberately have no prior override.

### HSGP over a model-derived predictor

A one-dimensional `hsgp` axis may be a sampled linear predictor or formula
assignment, not only a raw dataframe column. This makes a latent concentration
available to both a linear effect and a residual nonlinear effect in one joint
model:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
latent_hsgp_model = (@brm begin
    log(x) ~ 1 + factor(nominal_time) + (1 | assay | subject)
    sigma_assay_log ~ Exponential(0.5)
    c_obs ~ censored(LogNormal(log(x), sigma_assay_log); lower=lloq)

    mu ~ 1 + factor(nominal_time) + zbl + x +
         hsgp(x; k=5, domain=(0.01, 5.0), orthogonal_to=:linear) +
         (1 + x | qt | subject)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)
    qtc ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
end)((;
    nominal_time=repeat([1, 2]; outer=4),
    subject=repeat(1:4; inner=2),
    zbl=[1., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
    c_obs=[0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.31, 0.37, 0.44, 0.54],
    lloq=fill(0.3, 8),
    qtc=[1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.0, 2.1],
))
""", :latent_hsgp_model; title="Latent concentration with linear and HSGP effects")
```

The explicit `domain=(lower, upper)` is required because sampled `x` values do
not exist when Julia configures the basis. It is the actual compact HSGP
interval, so it cannot be combined with the raw-data expansion factor `c` and
remains fixed during `reprocess`, including with `freeze_constants=false`.
Choose it to cover scientifically plausible posterior support for every latent
`x`: the domain configures the approximation but does not truncate or otherwise
constrain `x` at runtime.

`orthogonal_to=:linear` centers every basis column and projects it off the
current sampled `x` direction at each draw. Use it when the formula also
contains `x`; the population coefficient then carries the linear association
and the HSGP carries only residual nonlinear shape. The option also works for a
one-dimensional raw axis. The orthogonality option is ungrouped: multiplying
the basis by group-specific weights would no longer preserve the global
projection. Model-derived HSGPs are currently one-dimensional, isotropic, and
ungrouped; raw-data HSGPs retain their variadic, anisotropic, and group-specific
forms when `orthogonal_to` is omitted.

After fitting, [`hsgp_population_curve`](@ref) evaluates the combined
population exposure contribution on a fixed grid without fabricating assay
rows or referring to emitted Stan names:

```julia
curve = hsgp_population_curve(
    descriptor, constrained_draws, constrained_names,
    collect(range(0.01, 5.0; length=100));
    predictor=:mu, coefficient=:x, term=:hsgp_x)

curve.linear  # beta_x * x, draws × grid
curve.hsgp    # orthogonal residual nonlinear contribution, draws × grid
curve.total   # the supported total exposure curve
```

`constrained_draws` and `constrained_names` must include transformed
parameters (`include_tp=true` in BridgeStan), because every posterior draw has
its own sampled training `x`. BRM uses those values to replay the exact fitted
intercept/linear projection on the new grid; re-orthogonalizing against the
grid would define a different curve. Evaluation outside the formula's fixed
`domain` is rejected. This is a population partial effect only: it deliberately
excludes the intercept, other covariates, and subject-specific random slopes.

### Interval-censored predictor

Use `interval_censored(x; upper=lloq)` when `x` is quantified on some rows and
BLOQ on others. Store the measured concentration on quantified rows and the
row-specific LLOQ on BLOQ rows; the convention `x == lloq` identifies BLOQ, so
no separate flag is needed. Each BLOQ row allocates one latent covariate value
between zero and its LLOQ, and the merged vector enters the ordinary fixed- or
random-effect design matrix:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
interval_censored_predictor_model = (@brm begin
    qtc ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
    mu ~ 1 + interval_censored(conc; upper=lloq)
    effect(mu, conc) ~ Normal(0, 2)
    latent(mu, interval_censored(conc)) ~ Normal(0, 5)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)
end)((;
    qtc=[401.0, 408.0, 415.0],
    conc=[0.7, 0.25, 1.2],
    lloq=[0.25, 0.25, 0.4],
))
""", :interval_censored_predictor_model;
    title="Interval-censored concentration predictor")
```

The term's default latent prior is `Normal(0, 1)`; use
`latent(<lp|:>, interval_censored(x)) ~ Normal(location, scale)` to set it.
The population slope keeps the ordinary address `effect(<lp>, x)`. Reusing the
same term as a fixed effect and a random slope shares one latent covariate
vector. `reprocess` rebuilds the quantified/BLOQ split from new `x` and `lloq`
columns.

This is a continuous latent-covariate model, not an `LLOQ/2` substitution.
For a BLOQ assay row the lower bound defaults to zero and can be changed with a
numeric `lower=`. Values and LLOQs must be finite; `x` must equal its LLOQ on
BLOQ rows and exceed it on quantified rows, and at least one row must be BLOQ.
The predictor form is `SBBRMI`-only and is distinct from the response-likelihood
form documented under [Likelihoods](@ref).

`gp` and `hsgp` are distinct terms with no compatibility alias. Both are direct
predictor summands carrying their own latent draws and hyperparameters, so
neither contributes a `beta_pop` coefficient. `jitter` belongs only to `gp`;
`k`, `c` and `by` only to `hsgp`. Both currently support `cov=:exp_quad` only.

### Column transforms

Applied to a raw column before it enters the design matrix. The constants are
fitted on the training frame and frozen, so [`reprocess`](@ref) replays them
rather than re-deriving them — see the replay contract below.

| Term | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `zscale(x)` | subtract the mean, divide by the SD |
| `center(x)` | subtract the mean |
| `standardize(x)` | mean/SD standardisation |

### Grouping factors

Used on the right of `|` in a random-effect block.

| Term | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `gr(g)` | ordinary grouping factor / strata |
| `mm(g1, g2, …; weights=(w1, w2, …), normalize=true)` | multi-membership — one coefficient block shared across two or more levels per row |

`mm` needs at least two group columns; omitting `weights` gives exact equal
weights `1/M`. Supplied weights must be present, real, finite, nonnegative and
sum to something positive on every row. It does not combine with `|ID|`,
`cv_groups` or `centered_groups`, which error explicitly.

### Response-level wrappers

| Term | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `mi(y)` | brms-style observed/imputed split — missing rows become parameters drawn from the same family |
| [`weighted(y, w)`](@ref) | typed observation weights on the likelihood |
| `truncated`, `censored`, [`interval_censored`](@ref) | truncation and censoring — see [Likelihoods](@ref) |

`mm`'s membership weights are part of the random-effect contribution and are a
different thing from `weighted(...)`, which scales the likelihood.

### Group-local kernels

| Term | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `kernel(args…) do …` | a per-subject model cell — the PMX/PKPD surface |
| `ragged(x, group)` | group a flat secondary row axis into the ragged per-subject view a `kernel` cell slices |

`ragged`'s `x` may be a linear predictor declared in the same `@brm` block or a
raw flat data column; `group` names, for every row of that frame, which subject
the row belongs to. See the [multi-axis population PK kernel](@ref) for a
runnable example whose subject and observation columns have different lengths.

## Fixed-one contribution: `offset(x)`

[`offset`](@ref) adds `x` directly to a population-level linear predictor with
coefficient one. It never allocates a `beta_pop` column. The argument may be a
raw-data expression, as in an exposure offset, or an already-declared sampled
scalar:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
offset_model = (@brm begin
    log_ka_pop ~ Normal(-2.08, 1.0)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1.0)
    eta_ka ~ offset(log_ka_pop) + (1 | p | subject)
    concentration ~ Normal(exp(eta_ka), sigma)
end)((;
    subject=[1, 1, 2, 2],
    concentration=[0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.5],
))
""", :offset_model; title="Sampled-value offset")
```

Use [`protect`](@ref) for literal data transformations whose resulting column
should receive an estimated population coefficient. `protect(log_ka_pop)` is
therefore not an alternative spelling: `protect` materializes raw-data
expressions, while `offset` preserves a model-value reference and fixes its
coefficient to one. Offsets are population-level terms and are rejected inside
`(... | group)` random-effects terms.

## Penalized smooth: `s(x)`

[`s`](@ref) adds a penalized one-dimensional thin-plate regression spline to a
linear predictor. It is available only in the `SBBRMI` StanBlocks backend.

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
x_smooth = collect(range(-2, 2; length=50))
smooth_model = (@brm begin
    y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
    mu ~ s(x)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)
end)((; x=x_smooth, y=sin.(x_smooth)))
""", :smooth_model; title="Penalized smooth")
```

The supported public call has exactly one numeric predictor and no keyword
arguments. Training values must be finite and contain at least 10 unique
values. Internally, `s(x)` uses a fixed rank-10 basis: two unpenalized
null-space columns for `{1, x}` and eight penalty-whitened range columns. The
range coefficients share a smoothing standard deviation whose default prior is
a standard half-normal; `sd(<lp|:>, s(x)) ~ Exponential(scale)` replaces it (see
[Term-internal priors](@ref)). The term contributes this complete smooth
directly to the linear predictor, so it does not receive an additional
population coefficient.

For prediction or posterior replay on new data, the default
`reprocess(sb, new_df)` and `restan_data(sb, new_df)` calls evaluate `x` against
the frozen training centers and basis. Passing `freeze_constants=false`
re-estimates the basis from the new data and therefore has fresh-fit rather
than prediction semantics.

### Difference from `bs(...)`

Bambi/Formulae formulas such as `bs(x, knots=knots)` create a deterministic
B-spline design matrix whose dimension and knots are controlled by the formula.
BayesianRegressionModels' `s(x)` instead represents a penalized thin-plate
smooth with the fixed rank and smoothing prior described above. They are not a
one-for-one syntax translation: `s(x; k=...)`, `s(x; knots=...)`, `bs(...)`, and
`t2(...)` are not alternative spellings of this term.

## Tensor-product smooth: `t2(x, z)`

[`t2`](@ref) adds a two-margin tensor-product smooth to an `SBBRMI` linear
predictor. Its public defaults follow the brms/mgcv `t2` catalogue surface,
with Julia tuples for per-margin options:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
t2_model = (@brm begin
    loc ~ 1 + t2(area, yearc;
                 k=(5, 5), basis=(:cr, :cr), full=false)
    rent ~ Normal(loc, sigma)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)
end)((;
    area=repeat(collect(1.0:5.0); inner=5),
    yearc=repeat(collect(-2.0:2.0); outer=5),
    rent=collect(range(0.1, 2.5; length=25)),
))
""", :t2_model; title="Tensor-product smooth")
```

Both predictors must be finite numeric columns with at least the corresponding
number of unique values in `k`. Each `k` entry must be an integer greater than
2. The current implementation accepts only cubic-regression-spline margins
(`basis=(:cr, :cr)`) and `full=false`; unsupported values and unknown keywords
are rejected while the `BRMI` is built.

Each marginal basis is split into a two-dimensional null space and a
penalty-whitened range space. Their tensor product has three unpenalized
null×null columns after the intercept constraint, plus independently scaled
range×range, range×null, and null×range blocks. At the default `k=(5, 5)`,
those penalized blocks have 9, 6, and 6 coefficients. Each block has its own
smoothing scale, defaulting to a standard half-normal and addressable
individually as `sd(<lp|:>, t2(x, z), <block>)` with `<block>` one of `rr`,
`rn`, `nr` (see [Term-internal priors](@ref)). The complete smooth is added
directly without an extra population coefficient.

`reprocess(sb, new_df)` evaluates all four blocks against the frozen training
knots, penalty decomposition, and intercept constraint. Passing
`freeze_constants=false` re-estimates them from `new_df`. Like [`s`](@ref),
`t2` is implemented only by the StanBlocks backend and is not available to
`VBRMI`.

## Term-internal priors

Some terms own parameters that no coefficient address can reach. `s(x)`'s
smoothing scale, `mo(c)`'s Dirichlet increments, `me(x, sd)`'s latent true
covariate, `interval_censored(x; upper=lloq)`'s bounded latent values, and
a Gaussian process's length scale and amplitude all live inside the term's own
submodel. A `dar` trajectory likewise owns its persistence and innovation
scale. None is a `beta_pop` column or a grouping-factor margin. They are
addressed by naming the term itself in the target slot, in the same
head-position grammar the rest of the prior surface uses:

```
<quantity>(<linear predictor | :>, <term>[, <component>]) ~ <distribution>
```

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
term_prior_model = (@brm begin
    y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
    mu ~ 1 + s(age) + t2(x, z) + mo(dose) + me(w_obs, 0.3) + hsgp(conc; k=5)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)

    sd(:, s(age))               ~ Exponential(2)     # smoothing scale
    sd(mu, t2(x, z), rr)        ~ Exponential(3)     # one tensor penalty

| head | term | parameter | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sd` | `s(x)` | smoothing SD | half-standard-normal |
| `sd` | `t2(x, z)` | one of the `rr` / `rn` / `nr` penalty SDs | half-standard-normal |
| `simplex` | `mo(c)`, `mo1(c)` | Dirichlet concentration | `Dirichlet(1)` |
| `latent` | `me(x, sd)` | latent true covariate | `Normal(0, 1)` |

| `length_scale` | `gp(x…)`, `hsgp(x…)` | GP length scale `rho` | `LogNormal(0, 1)` |

| `sd` | `dar(time)` | innovation scale `sigma` | half-`Normal(0, 0.2)` |

**Spell the term the way the formula does, minus numeric and keyword
arguments.** `me(w_obs, 0.3)` is addressed as `me(w_obs)` and `t2(x, z; k=(5,5))`
as `t2(x, z)` — the address names a term, not a call. A `:` in the predictor
slot is THE DEFAULT: it is the base layer that a statement naming a concrete
predictor overrides, exactly as on the coefficient and grouping-factor
surfaces. Specificity counts concrete slots, so an exact tie is an error rather
than a silent winner.

An address that cannot be honoured is refused by name while the model is
lowered — an unknown term, a term with no such parameter, a `t2` component slot
that is missing or names no penalty block, or two terms in one predictor
spelled identically. `term_priors(brmi)` returns the captured statements
(`class`, `term`, `predictor`, `component`, `family`, `arguments`, `keywords`,
`expression`) for formula-level provenance.

### Only model-scale quantities are exposed

The standardized raw innovations these submodels sample — `b_pen_raw`, `z`,
`beta_raw` — stay iid standard normal and are deliberately NOT configurable.
For a smooth, `Cov(f_pen | sd) = sd² Zpen Zpen'`, so a scale on the raw
coefficients would simply duplicate the smoothing SD and confound the two. The
configurable parameters are the ones that mean something on the model's own
scale.

### Current limits

- `sd` on `s(x)` / `t2(x, z)` accepts `Exponential(scale)` only. In contrast,
  an addressed shared grouping-factor SD also accepts the zero-centered
  half-Normal spelling `Normal(0, scale)`. `Distributions.Exponential` is
  scale-parameterized while Stan's `exponential_lpdf` takes a rate; BRM
  performs the conversion.
- `simplex` accepts `Dirichlet(a)` (one concentration, broadcast over every
  increment) or `Dirichlet(a₁, …, a_{K-1})` (one per increment of a `K`-level
  factor). The dimension comes from the data, so the
  `Dirichlet(dimension, concentration)` spelling used for a standalone simplex
  parameter is not accepted here.
- `latent` accepts `Normal(location, scale)`. The observation likelihood
  `x_obs ~ Normal(x_true, sd)` is never configurable.
- `length_scale` and `sd` on a `gp` / `hsgp` term accept `LogNormal`,
  `InverseGamma`, `Gamma`, `Exponential`, `Normal` and `Uniform`, with numeric
  hyperparameters. Both parameters are strictly positive, so every family
  except `Uniform` is emitted truncated at zero (`Normal(0, s)` is therefore a
  half-normal); `Uniform(a, b)` additionally declares `<lower=a, upper=b>` so
  the declaration and the density's support agree. An **anisotropic** term
  (`iso=false`) has one length scale per axis and the statement sets all of
  them; the isotropic form has a single shared one. With `by=g` the length
  scale and amplitude are shared across groups, so one statement configures the
  whole term.
- `ar(:, dar(time))` accepts `Normal`, `Beta`, or `Uniform`; every declaration
  stays within `[0, 1]`. `sd(:, dar(time))` accepts the same positive-scale
  families as a GP amplitude. The older `ar(time)` term's transformed
  autocorrelation still has no prior address.

The backend compatibility floor for configured `gp` / `hsgp` term priors is
StanBlocks `10529af04d42a330df383864059c2b61a11d9480`. These statements splice
a configured `SlicModel` value into BRM's generated model body. Earlier
StanBlocks revisions, including `c30d3a158ae6c996dee2423023ab6b35d2756fc9`,
trace that value before its `PHI` / `omega2` keyword data are bound and fail
with `Could not find omega2 ...`. Co-pin BRM revisions containing this surface
with `10529af` or later. Because StanBlocks is unregistered and both revisions
identify as version `0.1.5`, the commit SHA—not the package version—is the
effective compatibility check.

Omitting an explicit HSGP prior is not a model-preserving workaround. In
particular, removing `length_scale(:, hsgp(x)) ~ LogNormal(0, 1)` restores the
default approximation-validity floor described below, changing the parameter
support and the emitted Stan program.

### `hsgp` bounds its length scale by default

An HSGP with `k` basis functions over a domain of half-width
`L = c·max|x − mean(x)|` stops approximating the kernel it was asked for once
the length scale falls below

```
(4L/π)·√(log(100)/(k² − 1))
```

and the failure is **silent**: the model transpiles, passes `stanc`, samples,
and returns finite draws that simply are not that Gaussian process. On the
default `LogNormal(0, 1)` at `L = 1.5` that region holds 42.9 % of the prior
mass at `k = 5`, 18.8 % at `k = 10` and 5.7 % at `k = 20`.

Every `hsgp` term therefore declares `rho` with that floor as its lower bound.
The density is unchanged — only the support moves. Exact `gp` has no basis
truncation and is untouched.

The floor is emitted as **data** (`rho_lower_hsgp_<axes>`), not as a literal,
because `L` comes from the covariate: `reprocess(sb, df2; freeze_constants=false)`
re-derives it alongside `PHI` / `omega2` while the Stan source stays
byte-identical. Isotropic spellings share one `rho` across axes and take the
strictest per-axis floor; `iso=false` bounds each axis separately. `k = 1` puts
the formula at infinity, so that degenerate basis stays unbounded.

**An explicit `length_scale` statement replaces the whole declaration, floor
included:**

```julia
mu ~ hsgp(x; k=5, c=1.5)                     # real<lower=rho_lower_hsgp_x>
length_scale(:, hsgp(x)) ~ LogNormal(0, 1)   # real<lower=0.0> — floor gone
```

That is deliberate. It is how a pre-floor posterior is reproduced, and it is
what keeps `Uniform(a, b)` self-consistent — an unconditional floor would
overwrite `lower=a` while the density stayed `uniform(a, b)`, leaving the
declaration and the support disagreeing. The consequence is that the guarantee
is **default-on, not absolute**: an override with mass below the floor restores
the silent approximation error, with no warning. Either keep the floor in the
overriding bounds (`Uniform(0.84, 2)`) or accept the error knowingly.

!!! warning "This changes the posterior of existing unedited `hsgp` models"
    Models that never named `length_scale` sampled an unbounded `rho` before
    this default landed. If you version models by their emitted Stan plus
    data, treat the change as a new model version rather than a refresh of the
    old one.

## R²-induced variance decomposition: `effect(lp, :) ~ r2d2(...)`

[`r2d2`](@ref) replaces the independent per-coefficient priors on a linear
predictor's population block with a *joint* prior induced by a prior on that
predictor's coefficient of determination. It is a separate statement in the
formula block — addressed with [`effect`](@ref), never with a per-column
`effect(lp, coef) ~ Normal(...)` — and is implemented only by the `SBBRMI`
StanBlocks backend.

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""

    log_V  ~ 1 + wt + (1 | p | subject)

`effect(lp, :)` addresses every population coefficient of `lp` at once, and
`effect(:, :)` addresses them across every predictor — which for an `r2d2`
decomposition resolves only when the model has exactly one population
predictor, since the decomposition is per-predictor. An `r2d2` statement is
deliberately invisible to [`effect_priors`](@ref) — it names no single labelled
column — and is read back with [`r2d2_priors`](@ref) instead.

### What it emits

Writing `tau_bsv` for the predictor's total scale, the decomposition is

```
R2               ~ Beta(a, b)                                 # parameter
phi              ~ Dirichlet(alpha)                           # simplex
beta_scale[k]     = sqrt(phi[k] * R2 * tau_bsv^2 / Var(x_k))  # transformed
tau_resid         = sqrt((1 - R2) * tau_bsv^2)                # transformed
```

`beta_scale` is injected into the shipped `_popefs_normal` seam, so the
population block still samples as `beta_pop ~ normal(beta_loc, beta_scale)`;
`tau_resid` becomes the random effect's standard deviation. The column
variances `Var(x_k)` depend on data alone and hoist to Stan's transformed-data
block.

The intercept is excluded from the simplex. Its design column is constant, so
`Var(x_k) = 0` there, and an intercept is a location rather than explained
variance. A predictor whose only non-intercept column count is one needs no
simplex parameter at all: `phi = [1]` becomes a data constant.

### The random effect plays the residual role

The inciting shape is population PK: `log_CL` is a *latent* per-subject
parameter with no residual term of its own, so its subject random effect **is**
the unexplained half of `tau_bsv^2`. That is why `r2d2` derives the
random-effect SD rather than sampling it, and why an
`sd(...)` statement on the same block is rejected — the
decomposition already determines those scales.

### Keywords

| keyword | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `R2` | required | `Beta(a, b)` prior on the coefficient of determination |
| `tau_bsv` | sampled half-standard-normal | the predictor's total scale; pass a number to fix it |
| `alpha` | `1` | Dirichlet concentration over the non-intercept columns |

`tau_bsv` has no data-derived default. A latent per-subject parameter has no
observed response to derive a scale from, so an omitted `tau_bsv` becomes a
sampled `real<lower=0>` with a half-standard-normal prior. Fix it whenever you
have a defensible scale — it is the quantity the whole decomposition is
relative to.

### Current limits

All of these fail loudly rather than silently sampling something else:

- The random effect playing the residual role must be a single intercept —
  `(1 | g)` or one margin per predictor inside a `(1 | ID | g)` bucket.
  Splitting `(1 - R2) * tau_bsv^2` over several margins needs a second simplex
  that this decomposition does not build.
- A shared `(… | ID | g)` bucket is all-or-nothing: either every margin's
  predictor carries an `r2d2` statement or none does.
- `cor(:, ID)` is not yet composable; an `r2d2` block keeps LKJ `eta = 1`.
- Adaptive centering (`centered_groups`), cv-contagious sizing (`cv_groups`),
  stratified `gr(g, by=b)` groups, and `mm(...)` multi-membership terms are all
  unsupported in combination with `r2d2`.
- A column that also carries its own `effect(lp, coef) ~ Normal(loc, scale)`
  statement is dropped from the simplex and keeps that explicit prior.

## Bounded scalar parameter priors

A non-data scalar prior may add finite numeric `lower` and/or `upper`
declaration bounds. This is the direct spelling for a fitted positive scale
with the same fixed-hyperparameter Normal kernel as a Stan
`real<lower=0>` parameter:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
bounded_scalar = (@brm begin
    sigma ~ Normal(0, 2; lower=0.0)
    mu ~ 1 + x
    y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
end)((;
    x=[-1.0, 0.5, 2.0],
    y=[0.2, 1.1, -0.4],
))
""", :bounded_scalar; title="Bounded scalar parameter prior")
```

Only `lower` and `upper` are accepted, both bounds and all distribution
arguments must be numeric formula constants, and two bounds must satisfy
`lower < upper`. BRM emits the bound on the Stan declaration and the ordinary
family kernel in the model block, exactly as in hand-written Stan. This
surface is SBBRMI-only; a bound with sampled hyperparameters needs an explicit
normalized parameterization and is rejected.

## Scalar horseshoe prior: `coef ~ Horseshoe(...)`

[`Horseshoe`](@ref) attaches a scalar Carvalho–Polson–Scott shrinkage
hierarchy to an explicitly named coefficient:

```@eval
Main.BRMDocsComparisons.comparison(@__MODULE__, raw"""
horseshoe_model = (@brm begin
    beta_sparse ~ Horseshoe(local_scale=0.5, global_scale=0.1)
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)
    mu = beta_sparse * x
    y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
end)((; x=[-1.0, 0.5, 2.0], y=[0.2, 1.1, -0.4]))
""", :horseshoe_model; title="Scalar horseshoe prior")
```

The emitted non-centered hierarchy is

```text
raw    ~ Normal(0, 1)
lambda ~ half-Cauchy(0, local_scale)
tau    ~ half-Cauchy(0, global_scale)
beta_sparse = raw * lambda * tau
```

A sampled coefficient enters the linear predictor through an **assignment**
(`mu = beta_sparse * x`), not a `~` formula term. A `~` right-hand side is
formula-style only — an intercept plus population/group summands whose
coefficients `SBBRMI` allocates — so `mu ~ 0 + beta_sparse * x` is rejected:
`beta_sparse` is your own sampled scalar, not a data column, and the `.*`
product is what you want to write directly. Use `=` for any linear predictor
that multiplies a sampled parameter by data.

`local_scale` and `global_scale` are optional positive finite formula
constants. Both default to `1.0`; the no-keyword spelling
`Horseshoe()` retains the historical emission byte for byte. Literal
arithmetic such as `local_scale=1/2` is evaluated with Julia semantics.
Positional arguments, unknown keywords, nonnumeric values, zero, negative,
and non-finite scales are rejected during `SBBRMI` construction.

The current surface is scalar and each `coef ~ Horseshoe(...)` call owns its
own `(raw, lambda, tau)` triple. Consequently `tau` is “global” only within
that scalar hierarchy; it is not shared across several coefficients. A
genuinely shared global scale requires a vector/group horseshoe declaration,
which this marker does not imply. The standardized `raw` draw is intentionally
not configurable because its scale would duplicate `lambda`/`tau`.

Like other sbimpl prior surfaces, this is implemented by `SBBRMI`; do not
assume `VBRMI` has the same marker-specific lowering.

## Simplex-valued parameter: `s ~ Dirichlet(...)`

A non-data left-hand side with a `Dirichlet` right-hand side declares a
**simplex-valued parameter** — Stan's `simplex[K]` — rather than a linear
predictor. Like every other scalar-parameter prior declaration it is addressable
by name anywhere later in the formula block, `kernel(...)` cells included. It is
implemented only by the `SBBRMI` StanBlocks backend.

The [multi-axis population PK kernel](@ref) shows the executable base shape:
ordinary formula parameters feed a `kernel(...)` cell, while `ragged(...)`
attaches a secondary observation frame to the subject axis.

The inciting shape is a per-**event** multiplier: `diet` scales dose
bioavailability inside the cell, so what the model needs is a `K`-simplex
parameter indexed by an ordinal level — not a per-observation design column.

### What it emits

For `diet_share ~ Dirichlet(3, 1.0)`, the generated Stan declares the
concentration vector as data, the parameter as `simplex[3]`, and the model
statement as `diet_share ~ dirichlet(diet_share_alpha)`. Complete emissions are
shown only through build-generated comparisons rather than copied Stan fences.

The concentration is registered as **data** under `<name>_alpha`, which is what
sizes the simplex; the name is reserved, so a collision is rejected rather than
overwritten. A `simplex[K]` costs `K - 1` unconstrained coordinates and reports
`K` constrained ones.

Because the concentration is data, Stan drops the Dirichlet log-normalizer — a
function of `alpha` alone — from `target`, exactly as it does for any other `~`
statement with data-only hyperparameters. The sampled distribution is unchanged.

### Accepted spellings

Only the two genuine `Distributions.Dirichlet` constructors, with Julia's
parameterization preserved:

| spelling | meaning |
|---|---|
| `Dirichlet(alpha)` | concentration vector literal, e.g. `Dirichlet([2.0, 1.5, 3.0])` |
| `Dirichlet(K, a)` | symmetric: `K` components, each concentration `a` |

`@brm` is a macro over the formula block, so a bare Julia symbol on the
right-hand side is parsed as a formula **local**, not interpolated —
`Dirichlet(3, alpha)` with a captured `alpha` reaches the backend as a column
carrier and is rejected by name. Spell the concentration as a literal; there is
no `$` escape (`$` outside a quote is a Julia syntax error, so the macro never
sees it). This matches the rest of the formula surface — `r2d2`'s `alpha=` and
`effect(:, x) ~ Normal(0, 0.25)` are literals for the same reason.

Concentrations must be finite and strictly positive, and `K >= 2`: a
one-element simplex is deterministically `[1.0]`, so there is no parameter to
sample.

### Difference from `mo(c)` / `mo1(c)`

[`mo`](@ref) and [`mo1`](@ref) are population linear-predictor terms. Their
Dirichlet increments live inside a submodel and are not addressable from the
formula; what a bare `share ~ mo1(c)` hands back is a per-**row** monotonic
contrast vector of length `nrow(df)`. Indexing that by an ordinal level is a
silent double indirection — it transpiles and `stanc`-checks, but computes
something else. Use `Dirichlet` when you want the simplex itself.

### Current limits

- The left-hand side must be a non-data name. A data-backed response with a
  `Dirichlet` right-hand side is a simplex-valued *likelihood*, which has no
  density/pointwise/predictive support and is rejected by the family path.
- The concentration is a constant, not a hyperprior: `Dirichlet(alpha)` with
  `alpha` a sampled parameter is not supported.
- `Dirichlet(K)` — no concentration — is not a `Distributions.jl` constructor
  and is rejected; write `Dirichlet(K, 1.0)` for the flat case.
- StanBlocks-only, like [`s`](@ref), [`t2`](@ref) and [`r2d2`](@ref); not
  available to `VBRMI`.
