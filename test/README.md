# Running the tests

The files in this directory are standalone scripts, not a `Pkg.test` suite.
Run any one of them with:

```sh
julia --project=test test/adaptive_centering_bridgestan.jl
```

`test/Project.toml` is a superset of the root project: it carries every package
that any `test/*.jl` loads, so no test file fails at its own `using` line the way
three of them do under `--project=.` (see below).

One deliberate absence, and it is a standing rule rather than a gap:
**`ForwardDiff` is not in this environment and is not coming back.** BRM
differentiates with Enzyme only — every gradient in this suite goes through
`AutoEnzyme()` via `DifferentiationInterface`. No test file loads ForwardDiff,
so there is nothing here to work around; do not add it back to make a new
gradient site easier.

## One-time bootstrap

Four of the packages have to be **develop paths**, and absolute paths are
machine-specific, so they are not committed. Supply the three outside this repo
once:

```sh
BRM_TEST_STANBLOCKS=/path/to/StanBlocks.jl \
BRM_TEST_WARMUPHMC=/path/to/WarmupHMC.jl \
BRM_TEST_TREEBARS=/path/to/Treebars.jl \
  julia --project=test test/bootstrap.jl
```

That writes `test/Manifest.toml`, which is deliberately **not** committed (the
root `.gitignore` covers `Manifest*.toml`). Re-run `bootstrap.jl` after moving
a checkout, or on a new machine.

`BridgeStan` needs the BridgeStan C++ sources in addition to the Julia package.
`BridgeStan.jl` finds them via `$BRIDGESTAN`, falling back to
`~/.bridgestan/bridgestan-<version>`, and downloads them if neither exists.

## Why each constraint exists

Every one of these was paid for by a failed resolve; none is stylistic.

- **`WarmupHMC` must be a develop path, never a registry resolve.** The
  registry only carries WarmupHMC 0.1.x, and the root `Project.toml` bounds it
  at `WarmupHMC = "0.2"` — so a registry resolve is unsatisfiable, not merely
  stale. `[sources]` cannot fix this either: it is a Julia 1.11+ feature and is
  silently ignored on 1.10, which is this package's compat floor.
- **`StanBlocks` must be a checkout, not a release.** BRM does not precompile
  against registered StanBlocks; it fails inside a `@deffun` in `src/sbimpl.jl`.
- **`Treebars` is here even though no test uses it.** It is an unregistered
  *transitive* dependency of WarmupHMC, which pins it with a `[sources]` entry —
  ignored on 1.10, same as above. Without a path the resolve fails outright with
  `Treebars [e1e568c4] has no known versions!`. `Pkg.develop` can only fix a path
  for a *direct* dependency, so Treebars has to be listed in `test/Project.toml`
  as well; that entry is transitive plumbing, not a test dependency.
- **All four `develop` paths go in ONE `Pkg.develop` call.** Resolution has to
  satisfy them together. Developing StanBlocks by itself fails with `expected
  package BayesianRegressionModels to be registered`, because BRM is
  unregistered and is not yet in the manifest when StanBlocks' resolve runs.

## Why not `Pkg.test`

`Pkg.test()` cannot work here, so there is deliberately no `test/runtests.jl`
and no `[extras]`/`[targets]` in the root `Project.toml`:

- `Enzyme` and `WarmupHMC` are root `[weakdeps]`. `Pkg.test`'s sandbox resolves
  them from the registry, which lands on WarmupHMC 0.1.x and violates the
  `"0.2"` bound above. The only fixes are a committed absolute develop path or
  `[sources]`, and neither is available.
- A `test/Project.toml` already takes precedence over `[extras]`/`[targets]` on
  every supported Julia version, so carrying both would be two declarations of
  one dependency list.

Three files are the reason this environment exists — they fail at their own
`using` line under `julia --project=.`, before any BRM code runs:

| file | needs beyond the root project |
| --- | --- |
| `test/adaptive_centering_bridgestan.jl` | `WarmupHMC`, `Enzyme` |
| `test/adaptive_centering_warmuphmc.jl` | `WarmupHMC`, `Enzyme`, `DifferentiationInterface` |
| `test/plate_stress.jl` | `BridgeStan` |

There is no CI workflow for these on purpose: they need `stanc` and a BridgeStan
toolchain, so a GitHub Actions job would be red by construction.
