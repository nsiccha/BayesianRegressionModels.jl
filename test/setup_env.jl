# Rebuild the test environment.
#
#     julia --project=test test/setup_env.jl
#
# The test env has four external UNREGISTERED dependencies plus the unregistered
# BRM root itself. Each external package is materialized at a specific GitHub
# COMMIT under the ignored `test/.bootstrap/` cache; there is NO dependence on
# any shared `~/github/nsiccha/<pkg>` checkout. A full-SHA revision is
# branch-independent, so it does not matter that several of these live on a
# `dev`/`devibe` branch rather than `main`; the commit only has to be pushed to
# GitHub, which every pin below is.
#
# ReactiveKernels contributes four developed paths from ONE pinned checkout
# (the monorepo root plus the nested `ReactiveKernelsDistributionKernels`,
# `ReactiveKernelsPPL`, and `ReactiveKernelsPPLExamples` packages, which have
# no standalone repos).
#
# All eight paths enter ONE `Pkg.develop` call on EVERY Julia version we run.
# On 1.11+ the `[sources]` blocks in `test/Project.toml` (which mirror these
# revisions) would also resolve them; on **1.10, which is what this suite runs
# on, `[sources]` is IGNORED**, so a bare `Pkg.resolve()` fails with
#
#     ERROR: expected package `Treebars [e1e568c4]` to be registered
#
# an error that looks like a missing registry rather than a version-gated
# feature. This script is the version-independent answer.
#
# Bumping a pin is a deliberate one-line edit here (+ the matching `[sources]`
# rev in test/Project.toml), reviewed like any other change — not a silent
# consequence of whatever a shared checkout drifted to.
#
# It is idempotent — re-running it validates/reuses the exact cached checkouts —
# so it is safe to run before any suite when unsure of the env's state.
