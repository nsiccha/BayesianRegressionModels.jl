# test/probe_prediction_modes.jl — acceptance for src/prediction.jl: the two
# post-fit prediction modes (population-level "nore" and transported "recov").
#
# WHY THE SEMANTIC CHECKS ARE THE LOAD-BEARING ONES. It is easy to write a
# `nore` that zeroes *some* coordinates and looks right: the draw matrix has the
# expected shape, nothing errors, and the numbers are plausible. What proves it
# is reading the model's OWN transformed parameters back out of BridgeStan and
# asserting the per-row random-effect contributions `r_<lhs>_<g>` are EXACTLY
# zero — that is the model agreeing that it is at the population mean, rather
# than this file agreeing with itself about an index layout.
#
# Likewise for `recov`: the check that matters is not "the matrix has the right
# width" but that a transported draw evaluated on the NEW model reproduces the
# fitted model's log density when the new data IS the old data, and that shared
# coordinates survive a deliberately PERMUTED level order — which is exactly the
# case a positional splice gets silently wrong.
#
# Run: julia --project=<worktree> test/probe_prediction_modes.jl
# (needs BridgeStan reachable through StanBlocks; set BRM_PRED_RUNTIME=0 to run
# only the declaration-level half.)
