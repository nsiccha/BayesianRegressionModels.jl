# Changelog

All notable changes to BayesianRegressionModels.jl are documented here, newest
first.

Every landing that adds or changes public API (an export, a macro, a keyword, a
method, or documented behaviour a dependant can rely on) bumps the patch digit
in `Project.toml` and adds its entry under a new heading at the top of this
file. An entry that breaks something a dependant relies on says **Breaking:**
and what to change. A package or app that relies on an entry states its version
as the floor, for example `[compat] BayesianRegressionModels = "0.2.2"`. An
environment that pins an older BRM commit is then refused when it resolves
instead of failing at run time.

## 0.2.7

- `structure_of(builder)` and `priors_of(builder)` split a data-free
  `BRMBuilder` (from `@brm begin … end` or `brm(source; mod)`) into the builder
  of its model statements and the builder of its prior-address statements, as
  they already split a `BRMI`. `string(structure_of(builder))` and
  `string(priors_of(builder))` are the model's structure and prior cards, with
  no data bound; `optional(...)` priors stay as written. Snag
  `show-a-model-s-s-596039d4`.
- A builder prints an elementwise prior or a declared vector parameter as
  written, `effect(mu, x) .~ Normal.(0, 1)`, where it printed
  `.~(effect(mu, x), Normal.(0, 1))`.

## 0.2.6

- A plate output read at model scope is one value per cell, as the Julia loop
  leaves it: after `cnt[s] = v` in `@plate for s in …`, `cnt[g]` is cell `g`'s
  value, `sum(cnt)` adds the cells (elementwise when each holds a vector) and
  `sum(cnt[idx])` adds the cells `idx`. SBBRMI computes these for every cell
  shape; RKBRMI for cells that hold a number (vector cells wait on
  ReactiveKernels snag `summing-a-plate-eba2648d`). Snag
  `sum-a-vector-pla-812e04d2`, decision `09e0gc5`.
  **Breaking:** on SBBRMI, `sum(cnt)` of an output whose cells hold vectors was
  the total of every entry and is now the elementwise sum of the cells; write
  `sum(sum(cnt))` for the total. On RKBRMI, `cnt[g]` and `sum(cnt)` of such an
  output read the cells laid end to end and now raise an error until that
  ReactiveKernels snag lands.

## 0.2.5

- A predictor read through a `@plate` grouping may hold a term whose keyword
  data is not on the predictor's rows: the levels' coordinates in
  `hsgp(t; by = g, cor = multigroup((x, y)))`, a known level correlation
  `cor = C` on `hsgp` or `gr`, and `car(area; edges = (from, to))`. For
  example `st ~ 0 + hsgp(day; by = probe, cor = multigroup((probe_x, probe_y)))`
  read as `st[p]` in `@plate for p in groups(probe; order = day)`. Before,
  RKBRMI and SBBRMI counted those fields as rows of the predictor and refused
  it with "`st` read through `probe`: `st` has 40 entries (data vector
  `probe_x`) …", also when the term sat in a predictor read that way beside
  its other terms. Snag `rkbrmi-on-a-mode-0bd31c04`.

## 0.2.4

- A positive `@plate` cell latent can be given its total:
  `T::shares(total) ~ Law(args…)`, such as
  `T::shares(land[s]) ~ LogNormal(location, scale)`. `T` sums to `total` in
  every draw, with `Law` as its law on that surface. It is the Stan program
  `simplex[K] w; T = total * w; T ~ law(…)`: the sampler moves the K − 1
  coordinates of Stan's simplex per cell, and BRM adds
  `sum(log.(T)) - log(total)`. For a total from data this is the exact
  conditional given the total, which needs no observation of it. The total
  may also be a model value. Positive families only (`LogNormal`, `Gamma`,
  …); SBBRMI and RKBRMI; `brm_start` takes `T`'s values, which must sum to
  each cell's total. A draw of such a latent (prior predictive) is not built.
  Snag `exact-sum-constr-7ba55c76`.

## 0.2.3

- **Breaking:** `SBBRMI`, `generative_plan` and `brm_descriptor` default to
  `total_groups = ()`, the standard (non-centred) parametrization for every
  random-effect block. Before, the default was `:auto`, which emitted exact
  total coefficients for every eligible block. To keep exact totals, pass
  `total_groups = :auto` (or the groups to integrate). For blocks the data
  identify strongly or unevenly, S2Z (`s2z_groups`, `s2z_rho`) with WarmupHMC
  adaptive centring (`adaptive_centering_problem`) is the recommended
  alternative. Exact totals stay available and are not deprecated.
- `s2z_rho` takes one weight vector per predictor,
  `s2z_rho = [:mu => [1, 1, 1, 0], :sigma => 1]`, for predictors with
  different numbers of coefficients on one S2Z grouping. The pairs must name
  every sampled S2Z predictor and no other.
- Under WarmupHMC adaptive centring, each exact total column is centred on its
  own location, the least-squares fit of the column's totals on the
  group-level predictors of the coefficients it absorbs (the mean of the totals
  for an intercept-only block), so there is no location to choose. Other cells
  in a model with totals choose their centring weights when a warm-up window
  restarts. Snag `exact-totals-fun-f116d6b2`.

## 0.2.2

- `brm_start(sb, stan_model, inits)` takes a value for every level of an
  intercept-free predictor's cell-means block (`0 + g`, `0 + factor(g)`),
  `lp = (; g = ["a" => 1.1, "b" => 0.4, ...])`, on the link scale of a linked
  predictor, as `brm_start(rk, inits)` already did. Before, the Stan method
  found no coefficient for any level of such a block. Snag
  `brm-start-sees-n-5b61087d`.
