# src/nlme_view.jl — the nonlinear-mixed-effects reading of an RK-lowered model.
#
# NLME estimators (posthoc/EBE, FOCEI, SAEM; the separate NLMEEstimation
# package) see a population model as: population coordinates θ, subject-level
# covariance coordinates Ω, other scalars σ, and one random-effect block η_i per
# subject, with subjects conditionally independent given (θ, Ω, σ). The RK
# emitter already files one semantic record per sampled declaration it can
# address (`_rk_coordinate_record!`, shared with the cross-backend coordinate
# transport), so the partition is read from those records, never from
# coordinate positions or name guessing. Every packed coordinate must be claimed
# by exactly one record; anything unclaimed or outside the per-subject structure
# is refused by name.

    BRMNLMEView

The nonlinear-mixed-effects partition of one [`RKBRMI`](@ref), returned by
[`brm_nlme_view`](@ref). All positions index the backend's packed
unconstrained coordinate vector (`coordinates`, in packed order).

- `group` — the subject grouping column; `levels[i]` is subject `i`'s label,
  in the RK level order.
- `role[c]` — `:population` (population coefficients, including categorical
  contrasts, monotonic simplexes, ordinal thresholds and vector parameters),
  `:scalar` (other sampled scalars such as residual scales),
  `:subject_scale` / `:subject_correlation` (the random-effect scales and
  Cholesky correlation factors, i.e. Ω), or `:subject_effect` /
  `:subject_mixing` (subject `subject[c]`'s standardized draw or Student-t
  mixing weight).
- `subject_coordinates[i]` — subject `i`'s block, in a fixed order shared by
  every subject: for each random-effect block, its standardized draws in margin
  order, then its mixing weight when the block is Student-t.
- `block_margins[k]` — `(; block, predictor, coefficient)` for position `k` of
  every subject block (`coefficient === :mixing` for a mixing weight).
- `mu_references` — one `(; predictor, coefficient, link, population, subject)`
  per subject margin whose predictor also carries a population coefficient of
  the same name: `population` is that coefficient's packed position and
  `subject` the margin's position inside a subject block. The individual
  parameter is `link⁻¹(Xβ + Zη)` on the predictor's link scale.
- `rows[i]` — the rows of the grouping column that belong to subject `i`.

Subject draws are standardized (`η = diag(scale) L z`, `z ~ N(0, I)`): the
subject block holds `z`, and Ω is read through the scale and correlation
coordinates. Because the map from `z` to `η` is linear given Ω, Laplace and
FOCE objectives agree in either coordinate system.
