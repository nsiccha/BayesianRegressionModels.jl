    AdaptiveCenteringBlock

The unconstrained-coordinate description needed to adapt one ordinary
random-effect block without parsing generated Stan.

- `ranef` is BRM's emitted [`RanefBlock`](@ref).
- `target_c` is the parametrization of the compiled model: `0.0` for BRM's
  standardised `z` emission and `1.0` for a `centered_groups=` emission.
- `effects[k,g]` indexes term `k`, group `g` in the compiled model's
  unconstrained vector.
- `cholesky_free` indexes Stan's `K(K-1)/2` unconstrained values for a
  correlated block's `cholesky_factor_corr[K] L`; it is empty at `K=1`.
- `log_scales` indexes the unconstrained values underlying the positive scale:
  `tau` for a correlated emission, or `log_scale` for the `(1 | g)` fast path.

Construct with [`adaptive_centering_blocks`](@ref).  Indices are resolved by
name against the caller-supplied unconstrained-name vector; no ordering of the
whole parameter vector is assumed.

    adaptive_centering_blocks(model, unc_names) -> Vector{AdaptiveCenteringBlock}

Describe every ordinary random-effect block in `model` for adaptive partial
centering. `model` is an [`SBBRMI`](@ref) or [`GenerativePlan`](@ref),
and `unc_names` is the compiled model's unconstrained parameter-name vector
(for example BridgeStan's `param_unc_names`).

The result supports both BRM endpoints: the default noncentered emission is the
compiled target `c=0`, while `SBBRMI(...; centered_groups=...)` is target `c=1`.
Every intermediate source uses the triangular term-wise map

```
u[k] = c[k] * sum(C[k,l] * z[l] for l < k) + C[k,k]^c[k] * z[k]
```

with `C = diag(tau) * L`. At `K=1`, this reduces to `u = s^c * z` with
`s = exp(log_scale)` and no Cholesky coordinates. Consequently `c=0` is the
literal standardised draw and `c=1` is the literal model-scale effect.

Stratified `gr(g, by=b)` blocks currently raise rather than being silently
left fixed: they carry one `L,tau` frame per stratum and need a separate indexed
metadata contract.
