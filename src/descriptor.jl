# ==============================================================================
# descriptor.jl — ONE authoritative executable semantic model descriptor.
#
# A `@brm` block is already the authoritative declaration of a model. Until now
# a consumer that wanted to *mount* that model — render a form, offer
# fit/predict, address the draws, label a coefficient — had to assemble the
# answer from six different places:
#
#   * a hand-kept formula string / display name,
#   * `outcomes` / `linear_predictors` / `predictors` / `grouping_factors`
#     (introspection.jl) for the model shape,
#   * `generative_plan` (sbimpl.jl) for what BRM actually emitted,
#   * `popcoefnames` for coefficient labels,
#   * `data_columns` + `sb.preproc` for which dataframe columns are needed,
#   * and StanBlocks for the executable half.
#
# `brm_descriptor` collapses all six into one value derived from the single
# declaration. Nothing here is a second source of truth: every field is read
# off the `GenerativePlan` (which is itself read off the emitted SLIC body) or
# off StanBlocks' own `stan_descriptor`. The two compose BY NAME, and every
# place the correspondence can fail is an explicit, loud failure rather than a
# guess — see "Failing closed" below.
#
# Division of labour with StanBlocks (stanblocks-use §30):
#   StanBlocks' `ModelDescriptor` reports STAN-level structure — the data
#   block, the parameter/TP/GQ outputs, and which operations the traced program
#   supports. It deliberately does not know "this is a random effect", "this
#   column was z-scaled", "this coefficient is the slope on `x`".
#   Those are BRM concepts, and they are what this layer adds.
# ==============================================================================

# ---- inputs -----------------------------------------------------------------

"""
    BRMInput

One entry of the emitted Stan data block, with its BRM provenance attached.

The first eight fields mirror StanBlocks' `ModelInput` (stanblocks-use §30) —
`name`, `type` (the Stan center type), `size` (the declared size *expressions*,
not values), `constraints`, and the four flags:

- `observed` — the model conditions on this input (it is the LHS of a `~`).
- `held_out` — this input is cv-marked, so its likelihood contribution is
  dropped and it re-draws in generated quantities.
- `derived` — this input is another input's declared *size* (`y_n` for
  `vector[y_n] y`). Re-binding `y` re-derives it; never ask a user for it.
- `inlined` — folded into the generated source, never reaches the data JSON.

The last two are BRM's addition — the **schema link** back to the dataframe:

- `column` — the dataframe column this Stan input was built from, or `nothing`
  when it has no single raw column (a design matrix, a level count, a size).
- `transform` — the BRM preprocessing kind applied on the way (`:zscale`,
  `:center`, `:standardize`, `:factor`, `:mo`, `:spline`, `:gp`, `:hsgp`,
  `:static`, `:group_index`, `:ranef_factor_dummy`, `:multi_membership`, `:kernel_subject_count`,
  `:kernel_ragged`, `:protect`),
  or `nothing` when the column is passed through untransformed.

`column`/`transform` are read from the plan's `preproc` record and the BRMI's
own data columns — they are never inferred from the input's *name*.

# ---- outputs ----------------------------------------------------------------

"""
    BRMOutput

One thing the compiled model produces, with its BRM meaning attached.

Fields `name` … `source` mirror StanBlocks' `ModelOutput` (stanblocks-use §30):
`kind` is `:parameter` / `:transformed_parameter` / `:generated_quantity`, and
`generative` is `:posterior` / `:draw` / `:pointwise_loglik` / `:derived` with
`source` naming the observation a `:draw` or `:pointwise_loglik` belongs to.

BRM adds:

- `role` — what this output *means in the formula*:

  | role | what it is |
  | --- | --- |
  | `:population_effect` | a `popefs` block — the population-level design and its coefficients |
  | `:random_effect` | a `ranef_*` block and its internals |
  | `:group_block` | a `kernel(...)` / `plate` result and everything declared per cell |
  | `:parameter` | an ordinary declared prior (`sigma ~ Exponential(1)`) |
  | `:linear_predictor` | a formula linear predictor (`mu ~ 1 + x + (1\\|g)`) — an assignment, so no `~` declaration binds it |
  | `:posterior_predictive` | a predictive draw of an observation |
  | `:pointwise_loglik` | an observation's per-element log-likelihood |
  | `:stan_derived` | a Stan-level output no BRM declaration owns |

- `declaration` — the `GenerativeDeclaration` this output came from, or
  `nothing` for `:linear_predictor` / `:stan_derived`. Its twelve fields
  (family, dimension, constraints, the verbatim expression, …) are documented
  on [`GenerativeDeclaration`](@ref); reach for them instead of re-parsing.
  An output whose `name` differs from `declaration.target` is one of that
  block's *internals* (`pop_mu_beta_pop` under `pop_mu`).
- `logical` — the BRM-level quantity whose value this emitted Stan output
  physically carries, or `nothing` for an internal. It is narrower than
  `declaration`: `pop_mu_beta_pop` belongs to the `pop_mu` declaration but is
  one of its internals, so it carries no logical target. For a ragged
  `kernel(...)` result, `logical == :loc` can accompany an emitted `name` such
  as `:loc__pl_mem_1`; consumers keep the logical identity while addressing
  BridgeStan through the emitted name.

  **Every named value a `kernel(...)` cell assigns carries one too** — no
  annotation. The author bound the name and the value is in every posterior
  draw, so it is addressable by that name:

  ```julia
  pk_loc ~ kernel(t, dv, qt_y, log_CL, qt_base) do ts, yy, qy, lCL, qbase
      conc   = exp(-exp(lCL) .* ts)
      qt_loc = qbase .+ slope .* conc     # a cell value, not an observation
      qy ~ normal(qt_loc, qt_sigma)
      conc                                 # the RETURN
  end

  brm_output(d, :qt_loc)     # BRMOutput(name = :pk_loc_qt_loc__pl_mem_1,
                             #           logical = :qt_loc, role = :group_block, …)
  brm_output(d, :conc)       # the same cell's other named value
  brm_output(d, :pk_loc)     # the collected return
  ```

  Cell values are ordinary `:group_block` outputs of the plate declaration and
  compose with `brm_outputs` / `brm_output_coordinates` / `segments` like any
  other; their emitted `name` stays compiler-owned and unparsed. Only a
  top-level `name = ...` counts: a slice parameter is an argument (address the
  positional it came from), and an in-cell `~` is an observation (addressable
  through its own column's twins, below).

  Two consequences are deliberate. **Scratch is addressable too** — `CL =
  exp(lCL)` gives `logical == :CL` — so `brm_outputs(d)` is wider than the set
  of quantities an author would call primary. And **two cells may name a value
  the same thing**; both are claimed, `brm_output(d, :mu)` then refuses and
  names the candidates with their owners, and `brm_outputs(d; logical=:mu)`
  returns both for selection on `declaration.target`. That is the same
  one-logical-many-carriers contract an observation's two twins already use;
  the model still builds and unambiguous names still resolve directly.

  ⚠ **A predictive twin is not a substitute for the location it was drawn
  from.** In the model above `qt_y_gen` is `normal_..._rng(qt_loc, qt_sigma)` —
  noise ADDED — so it answers a different question than `qt_loc` does.

  For a predictive or pointwise-loglik twin it is StanBlocks' `source` — the
  OBSERVED QUANTITY — which is not always a declaration target. A top-level
  `y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)` gives `y_gen` `logical == :y`, where `:y` is also the
  declaration; a plate-nested `yy ~ normal(...)` over column `dv` gives
  `dv_gen` `logical == :dv`, where the declaration is the cell-local `yy` and
  `:dv` is a data column. Both twins of one observation share it, so
  [`brm_output`](@ref) needs `role=` to pick between them.
- `labels` — per-element labels when BRM can name them (population
  coefficients, via [`popcoefnames`](@ref)), otherwise `nothing`. A UI that
  would otherwise print `beta_pop.1`, `beta_pop.2` can print `x`, `g`.
- `segments` — group boundaries for a RAGGED quantity, carried through from
  StanBlocks' `ModelOutput.segments`, otherwise `nothing`. Group `g` occupies
  `segments[g-1]+1 : segments[g]` (with `segments[0] ≡ 0`) *within this
  output's own coordinates* — so it composes directly with the vector
  [`brm_output_coordinates`](@ref) returns, and a consumer never re-derives
  per-subject boundaries from a length column.

`role` is derived from the declaration, never from the output's name — a user
variable may legitimately be called `beta_pop` or end in `_gen`.

One executable operation the declaration supports. Operations are **derived**,

and without rendering a button that will fail.

- `name` / `title` — the identifier and a human label.
- `inputs` — the names this operation needs. **Read `origin` to know which
  namespace they live in**: `:stan` operations take Stan data keys (the
  neither-derived-nor-inlined subset), `:brm` operations take *dataframe
  columns*.
- `outputs` — the descriptor output names it produces (empty when it produces
  a new descriptor or the Stan source rather than draws).
- `origin` — `:stan` (delegated to StanBlocks' `stan_execute`), `:brm`
  (BRM-level: replay the declaration on new data), or `:override` (supplied by
  the consumer through `brm_descriptor(...; operations=…)`).
- `run` — the callable `brm_execute` invokes, `(descriptor; kwargs...) -> result`.

    brm_descriptor(builder::Function, df; mod=@__MODULE__, cv_groups=Set(), …)

Derive the one authoritative executable semantic descriptor for a `@brm`
declaration. See [`BRMDescriptor`](@ref) for the fields.

The `builder` form is the one to prefer — it keeps the `@brm` builder, so the
descriptor can also offer `:replay` (rebuild the declaration for genuinely new
groups):

```julia
builder = @brm begin
    sigma ~ Exponential(1)
    mu ~ 1 + x + (1 | subject)
    y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
end
d = brm_descriptor(builder, df; mod=@__MODULE__, name=:my_model)
```

# The derived operations

Each is offered exactly when the declaration supports it. Nothing is listed by
hand, so an operation that appears can be executed.

| operation | origin | offered when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:transpile` | `:stan` | always |
| `:instantiate` | `:stan` | always |
| `:fit` | `:stan` | the traced model has ≥1 parameter and ≥1 likelihood term |
| `:predict` | `:stan` | the Stan program emits ≥1 posterior-predictive draw **and** ≥1 BRM observation resolves to it |
| `:pointwise_loglik` | `:stan` | the Stan program emits ≥1 pointwise log-likelihood |
| `:replay` | `:brm` | the descriptor was built from a `@brm` builder (rebuild on a new dataframe, e.g. new subjects) |
| `:reprocess` | `:brm` | the declaration has no random-effect block, or every random-effect block has frozen same-group preprocessing (plain/`|ID|`/grouped-HSGP group indices or typed `mm(...)`; stratified `gr(g, by=b)` remains unsupported) |

`:replay` / `:reprocess` take the new dataframe positionally and return a NEW
`BRMDescriptor`; their `inputs` are the dataframe columns in `d.columns`, not
Stan data keys. `:reprocess` forwards both `freeze_constants=` and the checked
new-population `resample_groups=` CV/GQ re-emission described by
[`reprocess`](@ref).

# Extension points

These three keywords let a consumer extend presentation and operations rather
than fork the descriptor:

- `operations` — a `name => …` mapping applied AFTER derivation:
  * a callable `(d; kwargs...) -> result` adds a new operation (or replaces an
    existing one's `run`), recorded with `origin = :override`;
  * a full `BRMOperation` replaces the entry outright;
  * `nothing` **suppresses** a derived operation (hide a button the surface
    should not show).
- `titles` — a `name => String` mapping relabelling any operation.
- `highlights` — an ordered collection of included Stan definition names, or
  `name => caption` pairs. Names resolve through StanBlocks' authoritative
  definition inventory and fail closed when absent; order and captions are
  presentation metadata only and do not change `d.id` or the executable model.

Overriding a name the model does not offer is allowed (that is how you *add*
one); suppressing a name that was never derived is a loud error, because it
means the caller is holding a stale operation list — exactly the parallel
registry this type exists to remove.

# Failing closed

Five cases raise rather than degrade, because each is unrecoverable in a
consumer that keys on names:

1. **A declaration target that is also a Stan data input.** Every consumer
   keys on the name (form field, result target, BridgeStan lookup), so this
   cannot be auto-resolved. Rename the binding.
2. **Two declarations resolving to the same Stan output.** Ambiguous
   provenance; the descriptor refuses to pick one.
3. **`brm_operation(d, name)` for an operation the model does not offer** —
   errors and names the operations it *does* offer, so the discovery never
   moves into the consumer.
4. **Suppressing an operation that was not derived** (see above).
5. **Selecting an absent or duplicate Stan definition highlight.** BRM accepts
   only names that StanBlocks reports in the executable definition inventory.

One case deliberately does **not** raise, because it is a legitimate model:
an observation whose predictive draw the Stan program does not emit is
recorded in `d.unpredictable` and simply excluded from `:predict`'s outputs.
If that leaves no draws at all, `:predict` is not offered. The consumer never
sees a predict button that would fail — which is the point.

    brm_output(d::BRMDescriptor, logical::Symbol; role=nothing) -> BRMOutput

Return the unique emitted output that physically carries the BRM quantity
`logical`. This resolves BRM meaning to Stan representation without parsing an
emitter-owned name. For example, a ragged `loc ~ kernel(...)` result can resolve
to an output named `loc__pl_mem_1` while retaining `logical == :loc`.

`logical` is normally a declaration target. It is also the name of any value a
`kernel(...)` cell assigns — see the `logical` field on [`BRMOutput`](@ref) —
which is how to address a fitted noise-free in-cell location, with no
annotation on the term.

**One logical target legitimately has several carriers, and `role` is how you
pick one.** An observation `pk_conc ~ Normal(loc, sigma)` emits a
posterior-predictive twin *and* a pointwise-log-likelihood twin, both carrying
`logical === :pk_conc`. Ask for the one you mean:

```julia
brm_output(d, :pk_conc; role=:posterior_predictive)   # the *_gen carrier
brm_output(d, :pk_conc; role=:pointwise_loglik)       # the per-element loglik
```

The emitted names (`pk_conc_gen`, …) are StanBlocks' to choose and are NOT part
of this contract; that is the whole point of asking by role.

Fails loudly when the target has no emitted carrier or still maps to several;
the caller must never guess from descriptor order in either case. The
several-carriers message lists each candidate WITH its role, so the fix is the
`role=` to add rather than a name to hardcode.

  the declared quantity (`identity`, `exp`, …).

For `log(Vc) ~ 1 + weight`, ask for `logical=:Vc`. The returned intercept is on
the log scale, `link === log`, and `inverse_link === exp`; the emitted
`pop_log_Vc_beta_pop` spelling remains private.

Resolution is fail-closed. Missing or duplicate logical predictors, missing or
duplicate population carriers, unavailable/duplicate coefficient labels, and

Resolve a logical BRM output to its columns in BridgeStan's constrained
`param_names` (or an equivalent posterior name vector). Resolution first uses
[`brm_output`](@ref) to obtain the descriptor's emitted name, then matches only
that exact name or its documented container coordinates (`name.1`,
`name.1.1`, …). It never parses a compiler-owned plate suffix.

`role` disambiguates a target with several carriers, exactly as on
[`brm_output`](@ref) — a posterior-predictive slice of an observation is

```julia
brm_output_coordinates(d, :pk_conc, param_names; role=:posterior_predictive)
```

The returned integers index `constrained_names` in their existing order. For a
ragged carrier they compose with that output's `segments`: group `g` is
`coordinates[segments[g-1]+1 : segments[g]]`.

A missing carrier is an error, which catches descriptor/artifact drift instead
of returning an empty posterior slice.
