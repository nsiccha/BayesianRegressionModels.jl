"""
    me(x_obs, sd_x)

brms-style measurement-error predictor marker. `me(x_obs, sd_x)` declares
that the observed `x_obs` has Gaussian measurement error with SD `sd_x`;
the backend allocates a latent `x_true` and emits the observation
likelihood `x_obs ~ Normal(x_true, sd_x)`. Dispatch tag — see `_sb_me`.
"""
function me end

"""
    s(x)

Add a penalized one-dimensional thin-plate regression spline to an `SBBRMI`
linear predictor. The fixed rank-10 basis contains the
unpenalized null space `{1, x}` and eight penalty-whitened range columns whose
shared smoothing standard deviation has a standard half-normal prior.

The public syntax is exactly one finite numeric predictor, `s(x)`. At least ten
unique training values are required; keyword arguments such as `k=` and
`knots=` are not supported. The term owns its complete smooth contribution and
does not receive an additional population coefficient.

Prediction and replay through [`reprocess`](@ref) or [`restan_data`](@ref) use
the frozen training basis by default. This marker is implemented only by the
StanBlocks backend; it is not a deterministic B-spline expansion and is not
available to `VBRMI`.

See [Formula terms](@ref) for an example and a comparison with
`bs(...)` formulas. Dispatch tag — see `_sb_s`.
"""
function s end

"""
    t2(x, z; k=(5, 5), basis=(:cr, :cr), full=false)

Tensor-product smooth marker. The StanBlocks backend builds cubic-regression-
spline margins, separates their null and penalized spaces, and gives the RR,
RN, and NR tensor blocks independent smoothing scales. The current surface is
two-dimensional, supports only `basis=(:cr, :cr)`, and requires `full=false`.
Prediction/replay freezes the training knots and penalty decomposition by
default. See [Formula terms](@ref) for the full contract. Dispatch tag — see
`_sb_t2`.
"""
function t2 end

"""
    ar(time; p=1)

Autoregressive-noise predictor marker. Adds an AR(p) noise process
ordered by `time`. Only `p=1` is supported in the current sbimpl
emitter. Dispatch tag — see `_sb_ar1`.
"""
function ar end

"""
    Horseshoe

Carvalho-Polson-Scott horseshoe shrinkage prior marker. Use as a prior
on a coefficient:

```julia
coef ~ Horseshoe()
coef ~ Horseshoe(local_scale=0.5, global_scale=0.1)
```

`local_scale` and `global_scale` are positive finite formula constants and
default to one. sbimpl emits the standard reparameterised hierarchy
`beta = raw * lambda * tau`. Each scalar call owns its own `tau`; "global"
means global only within that call, not shared across several coefficients.
Marker struct only — the `@brm` parser never constructs an instance.

# samples `z` in one vectorised `std_normal()` call rather than `n_groups`
# per-cell calls in a loop.
#
# This path WAS a plate (StanBlocks devibe 9210b05). It is not any more. The
# plate could not carry cv sizing -- StanBlocks' plate branch returns before the
# `cv ? :quantities : :parameter` decision, so a plate-internal fresh parameter
# never consults cv at all and fails SILENTLY into a model that still samples
# per-group effects nothing informs -- which forced a duplicate
# `ranef_correlated_cv` whose body differed from this one in exactly one size
# expression. Collapsing to flat deletes that duplicate. It also costs nothing:
# StanBlocks now hoists loop-invariants out of plate bodies itself (snag
# `benchmarked-brm-20aa0361` item 1, landed `94a71a0`), which closed about half
# of the measured plate gap, and the residual is the per-call Cholesky logdet
# that a plate cannot avoid at all (item 2, still open).
#
# EMITTED-STAN CHANGE: the sampled parameter is now `<binding>_z_flat`
# (`vector[K*n_groups]`) where it was `<binding>_b_cols_z`
# (`matrix[K, n_groups]`). Models on this path recompile, and their unconstrained
# coordinate NAMES change from `<p>.<t>.<g>` to `<p>.<i>`, i = t + (g-1)*K.
# Consumers that resolve coordinates through `ranef_blocks` / `ranef_coordinates`
# (src/prediction.jl) follow automatically; one that hardcoded the parameter name
# does not. The column-major layout is unchanged, so the VALUES are the same.

# ---- cv-contagious sizing (opt-in; for out-of-sample / CV models) ------------
#
# There are NO `_cv` submodels. There used to be three; all three are gone. The
# behaviour is not: it is now a property of the CALL SITE, because every
# non-centered submodel above takes `n_groups` as an ordinary kwarg.
#
# StanBlocks' cv-contagion (see StanBlocks forward.jl:321 + types.jl:215):
# a parameter taints to a `:quantities` (generated-quantities re-draw) qual iff
# its TYPE is cv, and a type is cv iff its own flag OR *any element of its size*
# is cv. So a random effect flips to a GQ population re-draw exactly when its
# SIZE traces from a cv-marked input.
#
# The emitters therefore pass, for a group `g`:
#
#   n_groups = n_<g>              (a standalone data scalar -- no taint; the RE
#                                  stays a fitted parameter: the ordinary build)
#   n_groups = maximum(<g>_idx)   (for `g in cv_groups`; `maximum` propagates the
#                                  taint from `maybecv(:<g>_idx)` into the
#                                  declared size via passes.jl:23, flipping the
#                                  draw to a generated-quantities re-draw)
#
# `L`/`tau` keep their `n_terms` (untainted) sizing either way, so under marking
# ONLY the standardised draw is re-drawn -- a leave-all-out population re-draw
# from the fitted covariance, the semantics confirmed for QT's `source` knob.
# It stays OPT-IN via `SBBRMI(...; cv_groups=...)`; a build without it emits the
# `n_<g>` form.
#
# WHY THE DUPLICATES EXISTED, AND WHY THEY DO NOT NOW. A `_cv` sibling was only
# ever needed where the size expression could not be supplied by the caller --
# i.e. where the submodel computed it internally because it was a plate. A plate
# cannot carry cv sizing for a sharper reason than "the taint does not arrive":
# StanBlocks' `forward!(::SamplingExpr{Symbol,<:StanExpr})` (forward.jl)
# dispatches to the plate promotion and RETURNS before reaching the
# `cv ? :quantities : :parameter` decision, so a plate-internal fresh parameter
# never consults cv AT ALL. Making the plate's OUTER size cv-tainted does not
# help: the promoted parameter stays in `parameters` while the likelihood is
# dropped -- a model that still samples per-group effects nothing informs, with
# no error. Measured, not inferred. Once the non-centered paths stopped being
# plates, each duplicate collapsed into its sibling.
#
# STILL UNSUPPORTED: the typed-LHS `_by`/stratified path
# (`z::vector[n_groups, n_terms] ~ multi_std_normal()`). StanBlocks' typed-LHS
# forward (forward.jl:355) derives cv from the RHS call-args, not the declared
# size, so a cv size there yields a cv *parameter*, not a `:quantities` re-draw.
# `gr(g, by=b)` in `cv_groups` is rejected loudly rather than emitted wrong.
# Centered emission is likewise not combinable with cv sizing -- see below.

# ---- centered ranef variants (opt-in; for strong per-group likelihoods) ------
#
# The default (and `_cv`) submodels above are NON-CENTERED: the sampled
# parameter is a standardised `z ~ std_normal()` and the scale is applied
# downstream (`diag_pre_multiply(tau, L) * z`). That geometry is the right
# default for weak per-group likelihoods (few observations per level), which is
# brms' default and the shape every existing BRM model was fitted under.
#
# It is the WRONG choice when the per-group likelihood is strong -- dense
# repeated measurement per level, e.g. a PK model with many samples per subject.
# There the non-centered funnel inverts and the centered parameterization, in
# which the per-group effect IS the sampled parameter with the covariance as its
# prior, samples better. These variants emit that form:
#
#   b_cols ~ plate(; outer=(n_groups,)) do g
#       bc::vector[n_terms] ~ multi_normal_cholesky(0, diag_pre_multiply(tau, L))
#       bc
#   end
#
# They are OPT-IN per grouping factor via `SBBRMI(...; centered_groups=[:g])`:
# a group not named here is emitted by the non-centered path above, untouched by
# anything in this section. The returned VALUE is identical in distribution to
# the non-centered sibling's -- only the parameterization (and hence the
# unconstrained coordinate system) differs, so fitted draws are NOT
# interchangeable between the two.
#
# Shape: the per-group effect is declared typed-LHS as `array[n_groups]
# vector[n_terms]` and sampled with ONE vectorised `multi_normal_cholesky` call,
# rather than as a plate over a per-cell `multi_normal_cholesky`. Both transpile
# and both are stanc-clean. The reason to prefer the typed-LHS spelling is the
# Cholesky LOG-DETERMINANT: Stan evaluates `log(diagonal(L))` once per
# `multi_normal_cholesky` CALL, so `n_groups` per-cell calls pay it `n_groups`
# times where one array-vectorised call pays it once. A plate cannot express a
# vectorised MVN, so this is a floor the plate spelling cannot reach.
#
# Measured (BridgeStan us/gradient, n_terms=5, identical posterior -- gradients
# agree to 2.6e-13, log-densities differ by exactly the dropped normalisation
# constant n_groups*K/2*log(2pi)):
#
#                                     n_groups=200   n_groups=1000
#   plate, cell body written inline    198.3          859.4
#   plate, invariants hoisted          138.7          537.4
#   typed-LHS (this file)               85.0          348.7
#
# Note what the middle row says: MOST of the naive plate's disadvantage was not
# the plate concept, it was that `diag_pre_multiply(tau, L)` and `rep_vector(0.,
# n_terms)` were emitted INSIDE the per-cell loop where they are loop-invariant.
# That is FIXED UPSTREAM as of StanBlocks `94a71a0` (snag
# `benchmarked-brm-20aa0361` item 1): the emitter now hoists loop-invariants out
# of plate bodies itself, so the top row collapses onto the middle one and the
# rows above are kept only as the record of how the gap was decomposed.
# StanBlocks re-measured it at n_groups=1000 as 728.8 -> 476.9 us/grad centered,
# 626.3 -> 308.4 non-centered, both matching a hand-hoisted control exactly.
#
# The residual 1.5-1.6x is the logdet, and it is the whole justification for
# spelling this one differently from the rest of the file. It is a real cost in
# idiom uniformity, accepted deliberately, not an oversight. Closing it needs
# StanBlocks to collapse a plate whose cell body is a single `~` over a
# multivariate distribution with cell-invariant parameters into one
# array-vectorised call -- item 2 of that same snag, still open and not yet
# filed as its own row. If it lands, this submodel can go back to a plate and
# this whole comment can go with it.
#
# Scope: centered emission is NOT combinable with cv-contagious sizing. A
# centered block's sampled parameter is the per-group effect itself, which under
# either available spelling (plate cell, or the typed-LHS form below) sits behind
# the same StanBlocks gap the `_cv` comment above describes -- so there is no
# centered shape whose size can carry a cv taint. `SBBRMI` rejects the
# combination explicitly rather than silently emitting an in-sample block.

# `@stanonly` because `vector[m, n]` (an `array[m] vector[n]`) has no Julia
# emission; both helpers exist only to be called from the SLIC bodies below,
# so they are never invoked from Julia. `multi_normal_cholesky0` is the zero-mean
# array-vectorised MVN-Cholesky the typed-LHS `~` routes to (a distinctly-named
# `@lhs @lpxf` UDF, exactly as `multi_std_normal` is for `ranef_correlated_by`);
# `ranef_b_matrix` rebuilds the `n_groups × n_terms` matrix the public contract
# promises. The loop is why it is a `@deffun` -- Stan's `to_matrix` has no
# `array[] vector` overload, and `@slic` bodies cannot contain control flow.

    SBBRMI(brmi::BRMI; mod=@__MODULE__, cv_groups=Set{Symbol}(),
           centered_groups=Set{Symbol}()) -> SBBRMI

StanBlocks backend: walks `brmi`, emits a `StanBlocks.SlicModel`, and
materialises the data dict. Pass `mod` if you're constructing the model
from a module other than `BayesianRegressionModels` so SLIC's symbol
resolver finds your locally-defined submodels.

`cv_groups` is an opt-in set of grouping-factor names (e.g. `[:subject]`)
whose per-group random effect should be emitted with **cv-contagious
sizing** -- the std-normal draw is sized from `maximum(<g>_idx)` instead of
the standalone data scalar `n_<g>`, so marking the group index with
`maybecv(:<g>_idx)` at trace time flips that RE to a generated-quantities
population re-draw (leave-all-out / out-of-sample). This is used when
generating a CV model artifact; the default (empty `cv_groups`) sizes the
same submodel from `n_<g>` and leaves the RE a fitted parameter. There are no
separate `_cv` submodels — the size expression passed at the call site is the
entire difference. Plain `(… | g)` ranefs and cross-formula `(… |ID| g)`
buckets are both supported; stratified `gr(g, by=b)` errors if opted-in.

`centered_groups` is an opt-in set of grouping-factor names whose per-group
random effect should be emitted in the **centered** parameterization -- the
per-group effect itself is the sampled parameter, with the covariance as its
prior (`bc ~ multi_normal_cholesky(0, diag_pre_multiply(tau, L))`), instead of
the default non-centered standardised draw plus downstream scaling. Centered
is the better geometry when the per-group likelihood is strong (dense repeated
measurement per level, e.g. many PK samples per subject); non-centered stays
the default, and a group not named here is untouched by this kwarg. Plain
`(… | g)` ranefs and `(… |ID| g)` buckets are supported; stratified
`gr(g, by=b)` is not.

The two sets are **mutually exclusive per group**: a centered block's sampled
parameter is the per-group effect itself, and no available spelling of that
can carry a cv taint in its size, so `SBBRMI` rejects a group named in both
rather than silently emitting an in-sample block. Note also that centered and
non-centered emissions use different unconstrained coordinates, so fitted
draws are not interchangeable between them.

Formula statements `sd(:, ID) ~ Exponential(scale)` and
`cor(:, ID) ~ LKJCholesky(K, eta)` configure a shared `|ID|` block.
An SD statement can instead select one emitted margin with
`sd(predictor, ID, coefficient)`, or write `sd(predictor, ID)` when that
predictor contributes exactly one margin. See [`ranefcoefnames`](@ref)
for the authoritative ordered addresses. Omitted statements retain historical
defaults; Julia's Exponential scale is converted to Stan's rate.

Use [`stan_code`](@ref) to extract the transpiled Stan source. For
sampling, load `StanLogDensityProblems` + `BridgeStan` and wrap the
emitted `SlicModel` in a `StanProblem`.

# ---- declaration-driven generative plans -----------------------------------

"""
    GenerativeDeclaration

One emitted sampling declaration in a [`GenerativePlan`](@ref).

- `role` is `:prior` or `:observation`. A `:prior` includes structured latent
  submodels such as `popefs`, `ranef_correlated`, and `plate`, not only scalar
  distribution calls.
- `target` and `family` are the emitted SLIC binding and RHS head.
- `data_source` is the original data key for an observation (including a
  plate-local alias such as `kernel_y => dv`), otherwise `nothing`.
- `draw` is the canonical binding a generative executor should use for an
  observation, otherwise `nothing`. For top-level observations this matches
  StanBlocks' current posterior-predictive `*_gen` name. Nested plate
  observations are inventoried too, but consumers must discover their actual
  executable twins through `stan_descriptor`: the emitted names are based on
  `data_source`, not this plate-local target. A ragged base has a flat draw and
  a group-aggregate likelihood, both carrying the observed group boundaries.
- `context` names enclosing plate results, outermost first.
- `expression` is an exact snapshot of the emitted `~` expression.

The remaining fields decompose that RHS call so an executor never has to parse
the snapshot itself:

- `arguments` are the RHS call's positional arguments, in order (the rate of
  `exponential(1)`, the eta of `lkj_corr_cholesky(1.)`).
- `keywords` is a `NamedTuple` of every RHS keyword argument, verbatim.
- `annotation` is the LHS type annotation (`:(vector[3])` for
  `kernel_z::vector[3] ~ ...`), or `nothing` for a bare LHS.
- `dimension` normalises the *two* ways a declaration can spell its size into
  one tuple: the `m`/`n`/`o` (or `size`) keyword that StanBlocks' `autotype`
  reads, and the LHS `::T[s...]` annotation, which wins when both are present.
  `()` means the declaration spells no size of its own — it is a scalar, or its
  extent comes from the data or from a submodel's internals (`popefs`,
  `ranef_correlated`) rather than from this declaration.
- `constraints` is the subset of `keywords` StanBlocks folds into the declared
  type: `lower`, `upper`, `offset`, `multiplier`. **This is the field that makes
  a half-normal visible**: `std_normal(; n=3, lower=0.)` and `std_normal(; n=3)`
  differ only here.

Entries of `arguments`, `dimension`, and `constraints` are the emitted
expressions, not evaluated values: an entry may be a literal, or a `Symbol` that
is a key of the plan's `data`, or a larger `Expr`. Resolve symbolic sizes
against `plan.data`.

`constraints` reports only the constraints spelled **on this declaration**.
Families carry their own implied support (`exponential` is positive,
`beta` lives on `[0, 1]`) — that is a property of `family`, held in StanBlocks'
`autokwargs` table, and BRM deliberately does not duplicate it here.

The declaration is intentionally backend-level: it describes what BRM really
emitted after formula terms introduced their latent blocks, rather than a
second model-specific interpretation of the `@brm` source.

    GenerativePlan

An introspectable, replayable snapshot of an `SBBRMI`'s actual emitted
declarations. `model`, `data`, and `preproc` are copied together at plan
construction, while `declarations` inventories every emitted sampling site,
including priors introduced inside `kernel(...)` plates and every observation
in a multi-output model.

Construct with [`generative_plan`](@ref). [`stan_code`](@ref) accepts a plan,
and [`reprocess`](@ref) preserves the existing SBBRMI replay contract (including
its correct-or-loud unsupported cases).
Plans constructed from a reusable `@brm` builder also retain that builder so
`generative_plan(plan, new_df)` can rebuild the same declarations for genuinely
new groups.

This is a declaration plan, not an RNG executor: it does not claim that a
component-wise consumer draw is prior-predictive. Its purpose is to expose the
one authoritative program and provenance an executor must consume.

    reprocess(sb::SBBRMI, new_df; freeze_constants=true,
              resample_groups=()) -> SBBRMI

Re-materialise the SBBRMI's Stan data dict against `new_df`, **re-running** the
Julia-side preprocessing (decision nr3v8n A) — so the silent-stale-constant bug
of a naive per-column `sb.model(; col=…)` rebind is avoided. Returns a NEW
`SBBRMI` that REUSES the already-transpiled Stan model (byte-identical
`stan_code` when shapes are stable) with the new data dict.

- `freeze_constants=true` (default — prediction / replay): apply the **training**
  constant to `new_df` (z-score with training mean/sd, map factor codes via the
  training level set, rebuild the spline/HSGP basis on the training
  eigenbasis/(mean, L)). This is the operation Bruno hand-rolls outside BRM.
- `freeze_constants=false` (fresh-fit semantics): re-derive each constant from
  `new_df`, then apply.
- `resample_groups=()` (default): retain the fitted random-effect coordinates.
  Naming one or more ordinary grouping factors (for example `[:subject]`)
  re-emits the BRMI with cv-contagious sizing, derives those groups' levels
  from `new_df`, and marks their indices so their standardized effects are
  re-drawn in generated quantities from the fitted covariance. Predictor
  constants remain frozen unless `freeze_constants=false` is also requested.
  This changes Stan source by construction; it is the new-population/CV twin
  of the default same-group replay.

Covered: the Julia-side transforms (`zscale`/`standardize`/`center`/`factor`/
`mo`/`s`/`t2`/`gp`/`hsgp`), `protect`/implicit-fn columns (re-materialised on
`new_df`), typed `mm(...)` and ordinary plain/`|ID|` random-effect group
indices, `kernel(...)` subject counts and `ragged(x, group)` columns, continuous
× continuous interaction columns, typed observation weights, categorical
outcomes, and pass-through raw columns (plain data, `me` obs values, `ar`
time). Frozen replay errors loudly on an unseen fitted level. Stratified
`gr(g, by=b)` group-index replay remains correct-or-loud unsupported rather
than silently copying stale structure.

sbimpl extension hook. Override (e.g. in `bruno-ext.jl`) to route
`target ~ f(...)` where `f` is a known SLIC submodel family
(`logistic_dr`, `gamma_time`, …) straight to `target ~ <slic>(; kwargs)`,
bypassing the population-linear-predictor wrap (which would otherwise
multiply the submodel output by a fresh β).

Return anything non-`nothing` to claim the binding; return `nothing` to
fall through to the default linear-predictor path. The default method
(this one) returns `nothing`.

**Use `import BayesianRegressionModels: _sb_submodel_rhs!`** (not
`using`) when adding methods from a downstream module so the binding is
extended rather than shadowed.

**Reserved data keys — BRM owns raw grouping-column names.** Any raw
column used as a ranef grouping factor (the `g` in `(… | g)`,
`(… | ID | g)`, or `gr(g, by=…)`) is reclaimed by BRM's ranef pre-pass:
the raw labels are DELETED from `data` and replaced by a dense integer
index (`g_idx`) and level count (`n_g`), because Stan cannot consume raw
(possibly string) labels. So a hook must NOT stash its own vector under a
raw column name that the same model also uses as a grouping factor, nor
emit a reference to it — the reclaim will delete it out from under the
emitted statement, and the failure surfaces only much later, in
StanBlocks tracing, as an unresolvable-symbol error. Key consumer-owned
`data` PER TARGET instead, e.g. `Symbol(col_key, :_, target)`, which is
self-owned and order-independent. (`_sb_reclaim_group_col!` now turns a
collision into an immediate, correctly-attributed error at the delete
site rather than a late one in a third package.)

    pred ~ kernel(data..., per_subject_lps...) do slices..., lp_values...
        ...
    end

General group-local submodel term: broadcast an inline cell over the groups of
the linear predictors it is given.

The per-subject LP formulas own the population effects, covariates, links and
random-effect buckets — they are ordinary `@brm` formulas declared in the same
block. `kernel` derives ONE shared grouping from those LPs and evaluates the
`do` block once per group, with each positional passed in as that group's slice:

```julia
log_CL ~ 1 + weight + (1 | p | subject)
log_Vc ~ 1 + (1 | p | subject)

conc ~ kernel(t_obs, ragged(dose, dose_subject), log_CL, log_Vc) do ts, doses, lCL, lVc
    ...                                    # runs per subject, in Stan
end
```

Positionals split by kind. A raw data column on the kernel's own
one-row-per-subject frame is gathered into a per-group slice. A column living on
a DIFFERENT frame — a dose-event table, say — must declare its grouping with
[`ragged`](@ref). A linear predictor is passed as that group's scalar value.

Dispatch tag only — lowering lives in `_sb_kernel_doblock!` (sbimpl). The legacy
`model=` / `obs=` spelling and its anonymous `n_eta` block were removed by user
decision `130c904`; the `do`-block form above is the only one. A name such as
`eta_CL` is merely a user-chosen ordinary linear-predictor name—there is no
kernel-owned eta vector or positional eta-index contract in the current API.
"""
function kernel end

"""
    ragged(x, group)

Group a FLAT secondary row axis by a raw data column that names the subject of
every row. The marker has two formula positions:

- As a `kernel(...)` positional, `ragged(x, group)` gives the cell a ragged
  per-subject vector. `x` may be a flat data column or an event-axis linear
  predictor.
- As an observation LHS, `ragged(y, group) ~ Family(pred, ...)` groups a flat
  response before applying the top-level likelihood. The referenced
  `kernel(...)` result supplies the authoritative subject row order, so labels
  are joined rather than sorted or inferred from first occurrence. The emitted
  observation keeps the logical name `y` and therefore uses StanBlocks' normal
  top-level ragged outputs: flat `y_gen`, group-aggregate `y_likelihood`, and
  descriptor `segments`. This formula-boundary grouping is SBBRMI/sbimpl-only.

For the kernel-positional form, `x` lives on some frame other than the kernel's
one-row-per-subject frame — a dose-event table, say — and `group` names, for
every row of that frame, which subject it belongs to. The cell receives `x` as
a RAGGED per-subject vector.

`x` may be either a linear predictor declared in the same `@brm` block, or a raw
flat data column. It is the same grouping either way:

```julia
log_F  ~ 1 + vessel + mo(diet) + hsgp(log_dose)     # rows = dose events
log_CL ~ 1 + weight + (1 | p | subject)             # rows = subjects

pred ~ kernel(t_obs, dv,
              ragged(dose_amount, dose_subject),    # flat column -> grouped here
              ragged(log_F, dose_subject),          # predictor   -> indexed in Stan
              log_CL) do ts, yy, doses, lF, lCL
    effective_dose = doses .* exp(lF)
    ...
end
```

Only the REALIZATION differs, and the difference is forced: a linear predictor
is a Stan parameter, so it cannot be gathered on the Julia side — the plate
takes an index column and the cell fancy-indexes the unsliced predictor
(`log_F[rows]`). A data column is Julia data, so it is gathered directly into a
`Vector{Vector{T}}`, which StanBlocks ingests as a ragged column natively —
exactly what a hand-prepared per-subject view would have been. Wrapping a column
does not consume the flat original: a term that names it on its own axis
(`hsgp(log_dose)` above) still sees it.

Why the grouping is an explicit argument rather than derived: an ordinary
per-subject LP is grouped by the ranef bucket it already carries
(`_sb_kernel_lp_bucket`), but a secondary-axis population LP like the one above
has no random-effect term at all, and a raw column carries no grouping
whatsoever. The axis has to be declared, and `group` is that declaration.

ONE VALUE PER ROW OF `x`'s OWN FRAME — no expansion happens anywhere. If the
event table stores a compact schedule (one row per dose OP, carrying an interval
and a count) then `x` has one value per OP. Constructing `ragged(x, group)`
requires one `group` key per row of `x` and joins those keys to the kernel's
outer subject labels. That is local validation of the grouping operation, not
an inner-shape contract between cell arguments. Kernel compares no totals or
per-subject inner lengths across positionals; once each positional supplies one
outer cell per subject, relationships among the values inside a cell belong to
the cell body.

Dispatch tag only — lowering lives in `_sb_kernel_doblock!` (sbimpl).
Observation-LHS lowering lives in `_sb_sampling!`.

# `ragged(x, group)` does ONE thing, whatever `x` is: take a flat row axis and a
# key naming each of its rows' subject, and produce the ragged per-subject view.
# This helper computes that grouping — the row indices — and enforces the
# contract that makes it meaningful. Realizing the view is the caller's job,
# because a parameter and a data column can only be grouped in different places:
#
#   - a LINEAR PREDICTOR is a Stan parameter, so it cannot be grouped Julia-side
#     at all. The plate takes this index column and the cell fancy-indexes into
#     the (unsliced, event-length) predictor: `lp[rows]`.
#   - a RAW DATA column is Julia data, so it is simply gathered here into a
#     `Vector{Vector{T}}` and registered — StanBlocks ingests that as a ragged
#     column natively, exactly like a hand-prepared per-subject view.
#
# Same grouping either way; only the realization differs.
#
# `g_vals` is the kernel's per-subject label column IN ROW ORDER, because
# `_sb_kernel_doblock!` keeps cells in row order (see the ORDER note there).
# Cell `i` therefore gets the rows of the flat frame whose group label equals
# `g_vals[i]` — a LABEL join, not a level-index join, so it cannot silently
# disagree with the row-ordered linear predictors sharing the same plate.
# Nothing requires a subject's rows to be CONTIGUOUS, and nothing is reordered.

# block per field, and threads the un-expanded n_groups×K matrices into the term
# at emit time via `_sb_emit_group_block_term!`. Basis evaluation stays in-term.
#
# Three consumers shape this API: hsgp(x, by=g) (per-group iid-normal HSGP weights,

to fall through to the scalar `_sb_emit_prior!` seam and then to the

`simplex[K]` from the Dirichlet concentration, so the concentration has to be

"""
    popcoefnames(brmi::BRMI, lhs::Symbol) -> Union{Vector{Symbol}, Nothing}

Ordered labels of the population-level `beta_pop` coefficient columns for
linear predictor `lhs`, as emitted by the sbimpl backend (`SBBRMI`). The
k-th returned symbol labels the parameter column `pop_<lhs>_beta_pop.k`
1:1, so a consumer can turn raw `pop_<lhs>_beta_pop.N` posterior columns
into human-readable names without re-parsing the formula.

Only terms that sbimpl folds into the `popefs` design matrix appear, in
formula (left-to-right) order:

- the intercept `1` is INCLUDED (labelled `:Intercept`), at its formula
  position — conventionally first, `1 + …`; there is NO separate
  `pop_<lhs>_Intercept` parameter;
- plain continuous (`Real`, non-integer) predictors — one column each,
  labelled by the column name;
- single-`beta` wrapped terms (`mo`, `me`, `protect`,
  `log(x)`, `x^2`, …) — one column each, labelled by the emitted design key;
- an interaction `a & b` — one label per expanded treatment-contrast column.

EXCLUDED — emitted as their OWN parameters, NOT `beta_pop`, so they never
appear in `pop_<lhs>_beta_pop`:

- integer- or `CategoricalVector`-typed bare predictors → `cat_<name>`
  (K−1 treatment contrasts);
- `offset(x)` → `x` itself, with fixed coefficient one;
- `mo1(c)` → `mo1_<c>`; `s(x)` and `t2(x,z)` → their own fixed/range
  coefficients and smoothing scales;
- explicit-coefficient `coef * a` (own scalar);
- random-effects blocks `(… | g)` → per-group ranef parameters.

Needs a data-bound `BRMI` (any fitted model has one): the population-vs-
categorical split reads each predictor's element type. Returns `Symbol[]`
when `lhs` has no population columns (e.g. `loc ~ (1 | g)`), and `nothing`
when `lhs` is not a linear predictor of `brmi`.

These are the labels the `effect(lhs, label) ~ Normal(...)` prior address
resolves against — with ONE addition that is deliberately not listed here,
because it is not a `beta_pop` column: a categorical / integer-coded
predictor (bare, or wrapped in `factor(...)`) is addressable by its COLUMN
name, which sets one shared Normal prior over its K-1 treatment contrasts
(`cat_<c>_beta`). Everything else in the EXCLUDED list above still owns
parameters no `effect(...)` address reaches.

    #   1b. A data-backed column NESTED inside one of those terms
    #      (`_sb_n_obs_probe_deep`). A formula whose population terms are ALL
    #      wrapped — `loc ~ 1 + mo(diet) + hsgp(x)` — has no top-level peer, so
    #      tier 1 returns nothing even though the formula names its own row axis
    #      plainly. Tiers 2 and 3 then guess an axis, which is right only while
    #      every frame in the model has the same length: an intercept on a
    #      SECONDARY frame (`ragged(x, group)`) got `rep_vector(1., num_elements(weight))`
    #      — the SUBJECT axis — inside an `X` matrix sized by the event axis.
    #      stanc accepts that (both extents are runtime), so it fails as a
    #      dimension error at instantiation rather than at lowering.
    #   1d. A CATEGORICAL peer in the same formula (`direct_terms`). The term
    #      classifier (`_sb_classify_term!`) routes a bare integer-backed
    #      `NamedColumn` — `log(y_scale) ~ 1 + source` — into `direct_terms`,
    #      not `pop_terms`, because it expands to dummy columns. Tiers 1/1b see
    #      only `pop_terms`, so before this tier `pop_terms == [1]` and every
    #      deterministic probe came up empty even though the formula names its
    #      row axis in plain sight. On a multi-axis model that then hit tier 3
    #      and refused, telling the user to add a group term when `source` was
    #      already right there (reported against `Bruno:qt`).
    #      Uses the tier-1b probe rather than tier 1a's: a direct term may be
    #      backed by STRINGS, and `_sb_n_obs_probe` would hand back that raw
    #      name unguarded, emitting `num_elements(<string column>)` — which
    #      StanBlocks cannot type. `_sb_n_obs_probe_deep`'s live-numeric-vector
    #      guard admits the integer case and correctly skips the string one.
    #   1c. The formula's own GROUP term (`_sb_group_n_obs_probe`). A formula
    #      whose only population term IS the intercept — `log_ka ~ 1 + (1|p|subject)`
    #      — has no top-level peer for tier 1 and nothing wrapped for tier 1b,
    #      yet it still names its row axis unambiguously: the grouping factor
    #      IS the frame, so its per-row index column has exactly this formula's
    #      length. Deterministic, and it cannot pick a wrong frame the way
    #      tiers 2/3 can. This is the two-axis (`ragged(x, group)`) failure of
    #      tier 1b in the OPPOSITE direction: the per-SUBJECT `log_ka` was
    #      sized off an EVENT-axis column found in hash order, so
    #      `pop_log_ka + r_log_ka_p_subject` added an 11-vector to a 2-vector
    #      and every log-density evaluation threw (snag
    #      `two-axis-brm-an-9881c01b`, reported by `Bruno:arv393`).
    #      Deliberately ranked BELOW tiers 1/1b rather than ahead of them: a
    #      population peer in the same formula is on that same row axis by
    #      construction, so promoting the group probe would rewrite the emitted
    #      extent for every ordinary mixed model (`y ~ 1 + x + (1|g)`) while
    #      fixing nothing.
    #      A caller EMITTING a ranef block's Z columns passes `group_idx`
    #      directly instead: it already holds the block's per-row index, and a Z
    #      column's row axis is the grouping factor's by construction. The two
    #      spellings are the same tier and never both apply — the population
    #      path has `ran_terms` and no `group_idx`, the ranef path the reverse.
    #   2. The observation column threaded from the likelihood walker
    #      (`obs_n`). Covers purely-intercept formulas like `loc ~ 1` whose
    #      length matches the observed `~` target consuming `loc`.
    #   3. Hash-order fallback (`_sb_any_data_symbol`). Last resort; lossy
    #      for composite models with multi-length data and reachable only
    #      when none of (1), (1b), (1d), (1c) or (2) yields a name — i.e. a
    #      formula whose ONLY term is the intercept (no covariate of any kind,
