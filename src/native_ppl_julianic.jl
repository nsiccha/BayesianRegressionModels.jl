# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Julianic NativePPL — a "run-the-body" authoring surface.
#
# Goal (user, 2026-08-04): the `@model` body should read as valid SSA Julia that
# actually computes the log density, with `~` the ONLY magic — and `~` reducing
# to "prep + logpdf": constrain the unconstrained coordinate (+ log-Jacobian),
# then accumulate the distribution's log density.
#
# This is the additive Option-1 path (decision `0tuhucl`, resolved "use your
# judgment"): a new `@jmodel` entry point that lowers `~` and RUNS the body as
# the primal density `θ -> Real`, verified model-by-model against the existing
# declarative executor as a differential oracle. Once the gallery reaches
# parity, `@model` itself flips onto this lowering.
#
# Design
# ------
# * Only `~` / `.~` statements are rewritten; every other statement is kept
#   VERBATIM — that is exactly "valid Julia except ~".
# * `sym ~ dist` lowers to ONE operation — prep the value, accumulate its
#   log-density contribution — with the value coming from the conditioned data
#   when `sym` was passed to `jcondition` and from a fresh slice of theta when it
#   was not. The dot lifts that operation elementwise and nothing more, so
#   `@. y ~ D(a, b)` and `y .~ D.(a, b)` are the same statement (Julia's own
#   `Base.Broadcast.__dot__` performs the normalization).
# * The body runs twice against a context `ctx`:
#     - TRACE (compile): discover the total unconstrained dimension by counting
#       the coordinates each latent `~` consumes. Returns in-support placeholder
#       values so deterministic code and observations run without error.
#     - PRIMAL (density): a cursor walks `θ`; each latent `~` consumes its slice,
#       preps it (constrain + logjac), and accumulates prior logpdf; each
#       observation accumulates its data logpdf. The scalar `ctx.buffers.acc` is the
#       primal `θ -> Real` that Enzyme differentiates (same AD path the
#       declarative executor already uses — DifferentiationInterface + AutoEnzyme
#       straight through the primal kernel).
#
# Latent-vs-observation is decided by CONDITIONING, never by spelling. That is
# what data-vs-parameter means, it is what the architecture contract specifies
# ("free-coordinate allocation after composition and conditioning"), and it is
# what the declarative graph layer already does (`AbstractSiteActivity` in
# `native_ppl_authoring.jl`, assigned `hasproperty(conditions, name)`).
#
# An earlier version of this file decided it syntactically — broadcast meant
# observation, scalar meant latent — and needed two fail-closed errors to police
# the disagreement with the conditioned data. Both are gone: the check that used
# to throw now selects a branch instead, and it still folds to a compile-time
# constant, so the primal pays nothing for it either way.
#
# Supported latent site families, each one `_sample!` method pair (trace +
# primal) — the surface grows by ADDING methods, never by touching the lowering:
#   * scalar `Normal` (real support, identity) and `Exponential` (positive, exp);
#   * real-support multivariate (`MvNormal`, `product_distribution` of Normals) —
#     one contiguous block, identity transform;
#   * positive-support multivariate (`product_distribution` of `Exponential`s) —
#     per-coordinate exp transform, for a vector of grouped scales;
#   * `LKJCholesky` — the constrained correlation manifold, K(K-1)/2 raw coords.
# Observations take any `Distributions` likelihood in broadcast form. A
# multivariate family with NO method of its own hits the real-support probe and
# is REFUSED rather than scored against the wrong measure.
#
# Gradients run under the plain `DI.AutoEnzyme()` the declarative executor uses:
# the conditioned data is threaded through the body as a separate `DI.Constant`
# argument rather than stored on the differentiated context, so STATIC activity
# analysis suffices and no `set_runtime_activity` workaround is needed.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: `Normal`/`Exponential`/`StandardNormal` are ALSO names inside NativePPL
# (prior/declaration constructors), so we must NOT `using Distributions`-import
# them here — fully qualify the Distributions types/functions instead. In the
# macro-generated model body, `Normal`/`logpdf` deliberately resolve in the
# CALLER's scope (the user's `using Distributions`), keeping the body real Julia.
import Distributions
# `weighted`'s typed weight-vector methods dispatch on the StatsBase weight
# kinds, and `rand` on a wrapper distribution needs the RNG abstract type.
import StatsBase
import Random

# 0-alloc buffer-threading substrate (user directive 2026-08-04): every
# array-valued intermediate in the run-the-body primal is filled IN PLACE into a
# preallocated buffer via MutatingFunctions' `apply!!`, so the differentiated
# kernel allocates nothing per gradient eval — the same discipline the declarative
# FactorWorkspace uses (preallocated `FactorBuffers` threaded as a DI.Cache).
using MutatingFunctions: apply!!
# Destination SHAPES for those in-place fills, declared rather than discovered by a
# pilot run: `broadcast_size` for broadcast nodes (function-first, so it is its own
# entry point) and `output_size(getindex, …)` for gathers.

# --- Activity-analysis types ----------------------------------------------
#
# The macro records a static per-statement SKELETON (pure syntax: what each
# statement reads and writes, and whether it is a `~`). At `jprepare` — after
# conditioning is known — `_julianic_activity` runs ONE forward + ONE backward
# sweep over that skeleton to partition every statement into data /
# needed-for-sampling / generated-quantity, with NO values (the SSA statement
# order IS a topological sort, so no graph need be built). The partition is a
# function of (skeleton, conditioning), so it can move a site between `:sampled`
# and `:gq` when the same model is conditioned differently.

# One statement's syntactic facts, built at macro time. `write` is the name it
# binds — a `~` binds its site name; `Symbol("")` marks a bare expression that
# binds nothing. `reads` are the free names of its right-hand side, OVER-collected:
# a name with no model binding (`exp`, `Normal`) simply resolves to no dependency
# edge, so precision is unnecessary and only false-negatives (a missed read) would
# be unsound.
struct JulianicStmt
    write::Symbol
    reads::Vector{Symbol}
    is_sample::Bool
    broadcast::Bool
end

# One statement's assigned role, for `jactivity` introspection:
#   :observation — a conditioned `~` (a likelihood term; always in the density)
#   :sampled     — an unconditioned `~` reaching the likelihood (consumes a
#                  coordinate, prior scored in the density)
#   :gq          — an unconditioned `~`, or a parameter-dependent deterministic,
#                  that does NOT reach the likelihood (drawn / computed only in
#                  postprocessing; consumes NO coordinate)
#   :density     — a parameter-dependent deterministic on the likelihood path
#   :data        — depends on no parameter (constant across θ; computable once)
struct JulianicActivity
    write::Symbol
    role::Symbol
    is_sample::Bool
end

# The role sets a body's names fall into, each carried as a TYPE PARAMETER so its
# per-name predicate folds to a literal at the statement's call site — exactly the
# trick `_julianic_is_conditioned` plays on the data type. Three sets drive the
# lowering:
#   G  — generated-quantity LATENT sites (drawn only in postprocessing; no coordinate)
#   GD — generated-quantity DETERMINISTIC writes (a parameter-dependent deterministic
#        that reaches no likelihood term — skipped in the density, computed only where
#        a downstream gq draw needs it, i.e. postprocessing)
#   D  — data-only writes (constant across θ — precomputed once at `jprepare`, fetched
#        in the density rather than recomputed)
# An EMPTY set makes its branch dead code: a model with no gq latent, no gq
# deterministic and no precomputed data (the entire pre-AA gallery) lowers
# IDENTICALLY to the pre-AA surface — so both the 0-alloc primal and the oracle
# parity are preserved by construction. The pruning is Julia's own constant-branch
# folding at `run`'s specialization on this type, NOT LLVM dead-code elimination of
# an emitted-but-unused store: the losing branch is gone before LLVM sees the body.

# --- Buffer pool ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The pool holds one reusable flat `Vector{T}` per array-valued intermediate the
# body produces, walked by a cursor in body-execution order. It is threaded through
# the primal kernel as a `DI.Cache` (Enzyme shadows it; the in-place fills are
# differentiated through), exactly mirroring the executor's `FactorBuffers`.
#
# Storage is deliberately FLAT and concretely typed (`Vector{Vector{T}}`): a pool of
# heterogeneously-shaped arrays would be an abstract container and cost a dynamic
# dispatch per access. An N-D intermediate (`tau .* (L*z)` is K×ngroups) is served by
# `reshape`ing its flat buffer to the traced shape — a view, so still no allocation,
# and MutatingFunctions' `apply!!(cache::AbstractArray, broadcast, …)` fills any-rank
# destinations in place (snag `apply-0alloc-ppl-fb5b821f`, landed `0134a6c`).
#
# Sizing: a TRACE pass runs the body once with in-support placeholders and records
# each intermediate's SHAPE (`buffer_sizes::Vector{Dims}`); `jworkspace` then
# preallocates the pool at the workspace eltype. `_next_buffer!` grows the pool on
# demand for the unprepared path (`jlogdensity` without a workspace), so a
# preallocated pool never grows inside a differentiated call.
# It also carries the primal's own mutable state — the θ cursor and the density
# accumulator. That state is preallocated with the pool rather than constructed per
# call for the same reason the executor keeps everything in `FactorWorkspace`: a
# per-call mutable context ESCAPES into the body closure, so Julia must heap-allocate
# it, and one such box per gradient eval is exactly the allocation this whole piece
# exists to remove. `JulianicPrimal` is therefore an immutable view over this struct.

# --- Contexts -------------------------------------------------------------

# PRIMAL: walks θ with a cursor and accumulates the log density. Both the cursor
# and the accumulator live on the preallocated `buffers` (see `JulianicBuffers`),
# so this context is IMMUTABLE — two fields, both references — and costs nothing to
# construct per call. A mutable context here would be heap-boxed on every gradient
# eval, because it escapes into the body closure.
#
# The observation DATA is deliberately NOT a field here: it is a run-time
# constant, and mixing a constant array with the active `theta`/`acc` inside one
# struct is exactly what forced Enzyme's `set_runtime_activity`. Instead the body's
# `run` closure takes the data as a SEPARATE argument (passed through DI as a
# `Constant`), so this struct holds only active state and STATIC activity
# suffices — no runtime-activity workaround.
# A context that WALKS θ: it constrains each site's coordinates and returns the
# natural-space value, so every deterministic in the body computes for real.
# `JulianicPrimal` accumulates the log density while doing it; the postprocessing
# contexts (below) do the identical walk and record instead. Sharing the abstract
# type is what makes postprocessing structurally unable to disagree with the
# density — there is one walk, not a walk and a reimplementation of it.

# The contexts that WALK θ. The per-family `_sample!` table is keyed on this, not
# on `JulianicRun`, because reading a coordinate and applying its constraining

# The declarative surface spells a weighted observation
# `y ~ weighted(Normal(mu, sigma), fweights(n))`, and the weight KIND — carried
# by the StatsBase constructor's NAME — selects the semantics at lowering time:
# `:analytic` scales precision (`Normal(mu, sigma/sqrt(w))`), `:frequency` and
# `:power` MULTIPLY the log density by `w`, `:unit` is a no-op. That taxonomy is
# a FORMULA-surface device: a declaration cannot say `sigma/sqrt(w)`, so the
# weight type has to say it for the author.
#
# A julianic body is ordinary Julia, so it says it directly:
#
#   analytic:  `@. y ~ Normal(mu, sigma / sqrt(w))`     — already expressible
#   unit:      `@. y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)`               — just omit the weight
#
# What plain Julia has no spelling for is the MULTIPLY: `logpdf` returns a
# number, and there is no distribution whose density is another's raised to a
# power. That is the one real gap, and this closes it — as a runtime wrapper
# distribution, per decision `06le2au`. `weighted` is BRM's existing formula
# marker (`src/macro.jl`, declared with no methods); this gives it an executable
# method, so ONE name means the same thing on both surfaces.
#
# The result is a genuine `Distributions.Distribution` — the point of julianic
# is that the body is real Julia, so `logpdf(weighted(d, 2.0), y)` must work
# outside the macro too. It is deliberately NOT normalized: `w * logpdf` is a
# pseudo-likelihood for any `w != 1`, exactly as the declarative `:frequency` /

This is the `:frequency` / `:power` semantics (the weight MULTIPLIES the log

them directly: `:analytic` weights scale precision — `@. y ~ Normal(mu, sigma /

`weight * logpdf` is a pseudo-likelihood, not a normalized density, for any

the base distribution's.

# the result SHAPE so the pool can be presized. Both passes execute the same lowered
# body, so the push order (trace) and the walk order (primal) stay in lockstep.
#
# Shapes come from OutputSignatures — `broadcast_size` for a broadcast node (it is
# function-first, so it has its own entry point rather than the `x`-first
# `output_size`) and `output_size(getindex, …)` for a gather — which is exactly what
# that package is for: the destination shape from immediately-available information,
# no pilot run (snag `broadcast-gather-3d8a0849`, landed `121de31`).
#
# ONLY floating-point intermediates may go through the pool. The pool is a flat
# `Vector{T}` at the workspace/AD eltype, so anything else routed through it comes
# back RETYPED: an index vector `[2, 4]` returns as `[2.0, 4.0]` and is no longer a
# valid index, and a `Bool` mask returns as `[1.0, 0.0, …]` and silently stops being
# a mask. Both are ordinary things to compute in a model body (`selector[group]`,

# buffer instead of a fresh allocation, so the differentiated kernel is literally
# 0-alloc (user directive 2026-08-04; decision `08w0buk` option B). The rewrite is
# per-NODE, bottom-up:
#
#   `beta[1] .+ beta[2] .* x .+ b[group]`
#     ->  t1 = _cached_gather!(ctx, b, group)             # b[group]

#         t4 = _cached_broadcast!(ctx, +, t3, t1)
#
# which is exactly `apply!!(buffer, broadcast|getindex, …)` — MutatingFunctions'
# registered 0-alloc forms — with the buffers presized from the trace pass.
# Scalar-only expressions are left VERBATIM (nothing to buffer), so the body stays

# statement reads and writes computes the data / needed-for-sampling /
# generated-quantity partition with NO values. Two properties make that sound, and
# each is enforced here with a loud macro-expansion error rather than left as a
# silent assumption:
#
#   * NO value-dependent control flow. A branch or loop makes "which statements
#     run" depend on the position, so one static statement list could no longer
#     stand for the graph. Same constraint StanBlocks imposes.
#   * SINGLE ASSIGNMENT. Each name is written once, so "the statement that defines
#     `n`" is unambiguous — that is exactly the edge the analysis follows. In-place
#     mutation (`x[i] = v`, `x .= v`, `x += v`) and reassignment both break it.
#
# Both NARROW the surface the walking skeleton accepted; the gallery uses neither

Julianic NativePPL model: the body is valid SSA Julia except `~`, which reduces
to prep + accumulate. Calling `name(inputs...)` returns a `JulianicModel`;
condition it with `jcondition`, `jprepare` it, then evaluate with `jlogdensity` /
`jlogdensity_and_gradient!` (see `jworkspace` for the required AD backend).

Every `~` is ONE operation, whatever dots surround it:

  * **prep** — if the name was passed to `jcondition` the value is that data; if
    not, it is a fresh slice of the unconstrained position, constrained with its
    log-Jacobian.
  * **accumulate** — the log-density contribution, either way.

So **conditioning decides what is data**, not spelling: `y ~ Normal(mu, sigma)`
scores an observation when `y` is conditioned and declares a latent when it is
not. The dot carries only its ordinary Julia meaning — lift elementwise — which
is why `@. y ~ D(a, b)` and `y .~ D.(a, b)` are the same statement, and why
`b .~ Normal.(0, tau)` is simply k independent sites.
