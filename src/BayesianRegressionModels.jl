module BayesianRegressionModels

# @brm macro — parses a formula block, produces a BRMI (BRM
# intermediate: expression tree + column metadata).
using OrderedCollections

# Introspection helpers on a BRMI -- outcomes / linear predictors /
# grouping factors / continuous & categorical predictors / RE terms.
# Used by web-macro's auto-PPC detector (and any downstream code that
# wants the model shape without re-walking the operations dict).

# VBRMI — vectorized implementation. Materializes predictors and
# likelihood into a LogDensityProblems-compatible object.

# BRMDescriptor — ONE authoritative executable semantic model descriptor.
# Collapses the GenerativePlan (what BRM emitted), introspection.jl (the
# formula shape), the preproc record (dataframe provenance) and StanBlocks'
# own `stan_descriptor` (the executable half) into one reflectable value with
# derived operations, so a consumer mounts a declaration without keeping any
# parallel registry of its own.

# Post-fit prediction modes — population-level ("no random effects") and
# transported ("same draws, new covariates / new group levels") prediction.
# Both are unconstrained-draw-matrix operations whose correctness depends on
# the emitted random-effect parameterization, so they live next to the emitter
# rather than being re-derived (differently) in every consumer.

# wrappers. Note `NativePPL` exports its OWN `Exponential`/`StandardNormal` —
# the DECLARATIVE prior *declarations*, a different thing — so a caller who
# `using`s both modules must qualify that one name; `Normal` does not clash at
