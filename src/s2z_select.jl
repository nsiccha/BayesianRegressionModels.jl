    select_s2z_rho(s2z_model, pilot_model, draws, names; obs_prec, group,
                   predictor=nothing, aggregate=:median)

Select per-cell S2Z centering weights from a saved pilot fit. `draws`/`names`
are the pilot's posterior draws in the COMPILED (unconstrained) frame with one
column per name; `obs_prec` is the draws-by-observations expected observation
precision matrix (`obs_prec[d, n]`, caller-computed from the pilot draws, e.g.
`1 ./ sigma[d, n].^2` for Gaussian location). No density or gradient calls are
made.

For each draw and coefficient, group information matrices are rebuilt from
`obs_prec` and the S2Z block's retained design, per-draw group scales come
from the pilot's `<binding>_log_scale` / `<binding>_tau` coordinates, and raw
reliabilities come from [`_s2z_fisher_raw`](@ref). Cells aggregate across
draws (`aggregate`, `:median` or `:mean`) and rescale ONCE at the aggregated
scale — never median-of-rescaled-rho, which mixes the chart nonlinearity with
per-draw scale variation and is fragile under approximate pilots.

The pilot must cover the same grouping with identical levels and row order
(checked against the pilot's preprocessing record, loudly refused otherwise).
Returns `(; rho, raw, sd, carriers, n_draws, group, columns)`: `rho` feeds
`SBBRMI(...; s2z_rho=rho)` directly.
